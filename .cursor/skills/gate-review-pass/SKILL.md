# Gate Review Pass

**Preferred activation (operator):** say the exact phrase **`gate review`**.

Use this skill when the operator wants a structured review pass over pending candidates without taking action yet.

**Sensemaking layer:** approving or rejecting here is **human judgment** (Approval Inbox); agents only **stage**. Routing vs sensemaking vs accountability: [`docs/governance-unbundling.md`](../../docs/governance-unbundling.md).

## Default command

```bash
python3 scripts/operator_gate_review_pass.py -u grace-mar
```

## Territory filters

Use a narrower review lens when needed:

```bash
python3 scripts/operator_gate_review_pass.py -u grace-mar --territory companion
python3 scripts/operator_gate_review_pass.py -u grace-mar --territory work-politics
```

## What to return

For each candidate, show **only the review-essential fields**:

- **id** and one-line **summary**
- **source_exchange** or **source** (grounding evidence)
- **suggested_entry** (what would be merged)
- **age** (days since timestamp — flag if >14 days)
- **staleness** (wall-clock + active-day age, superseded hints, warrant drift — run `score_gate_staleness.py` first for enriched data)
- **risk_tier** from the review script (quick_merge_eligible / review_batch / manual_escalate)
- **duplicate_hints** if any

Do **not** show pipeline plumbing by default: `channel_key`, `signal_type`, `priority_score`, `profile_target`, `prompt_section`, `prompt_addition`, `mind_category`. These are available in the file if the operator asks.

Then give a recommendation per candidate:

- approve now
- investigate duplicates
- manual escalation (explain why)
- stale — review or reject
- defer or batch review

## Guardrails

- This workflow does not approve, reject, or merge anything by itself.
- Keep companion and work-politics items distinct when that affects review.
- Treat duplicate hints as prompts to verify, not proof that a candidate should be rejected.
- Rejected candidates are auto-swept to Processed on the next `coffee` run — no manual cleanup needed.

## Alternative lens: Disruption-to-Value

When the operator says **"radar lens"** or **"DTV"**, reframe each candidate using builder vocabulary:

| Radar verdict | Gate equivalent | When to use |
|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| Keep building | defer | Real signal, but switching cost exceeds value now |
| Integrate when convenient | approve (batch) | Low friction, fold in at next review pass |
| Pause and adopt | approve now | Materially changes the profile — worth stopping for |
| Foundational shift | approve with escalation | Rewrites a section of SELF — check contradictions first |

This is a relabeling, not new logic. Use whichever vocabulary fits the operator's current thinking mode.

## After a batch review — doc-only pattern library

**Optional operator habit:** After companion decisions (approve / defer / reject) or after a long idle queue, note whether **duplicate_hints**, **risk_tier**, or **age** guidance was **misleading**.

**Recursive tightening:** If the **same** mispattern appears **twice**, add **one** bullet to **this skill** (under this section) or to [docs/operator-skills.md](../../docs/operator-skills.md) § *Gate review — pattern notes*. Do not change `recursion-gate.md` from this loop alone — that stays companion-governed.

## Pre-review: capability shift check

Before a gate pass, optionally run the capability shift detector to check whether pending candidates reference assumptions that a recent model release may have compressed:

```bash
python3 scripts/detect_capability_shift.py -u grace-mar --offline
```

If any alert shows `REVIEW`, cross-reference the affected files against pending candidates — a candidate that bakes in an assumption a new model has obsoleted may need rewording or deferral.
