# Repo Hygiene Pass

**Preferred activation (operator):** say **`hygiene pass`**.

Use this skill when the working tree has mixed changes and you want clean, intent-based commits.

## When to run

- Multiple unrelated changes are mixed in one status view.
- You need to separate feature/docs work from generated index churn.
- Scratch or local test folders keep showing up as untracked noise.

## Workflow

1. Run preflight:
   - `git status --short`
   - `git diff --name-only`
   - `git diff --cached --name-only`
2. Partition files into 2-4 buckets by intent:
   - main task bundle,
   - generated/index refresh,
   - scratch/local-only files,
   - optional follow-up bucket.
3. Commit bucket 1 only:
   - stage explicit paths (never broad `git add .` in mixed trees),
   - verify staged diff,
   - write a message that explains why.
4. Commit bucket 2 only (if needed), same pattern.
5. Keep scratch noise out of future commits:
   - prefer local excludes for machine-local dirs,
   - avoid adding team-wide ignores unless requested.
6. End with clean check:
   - `git status --short`
   - confirm remaining files are intentional.

## Push-prep add-on (optional)

Use when commit grouping is done and you are deciding whether to publish:

1. Confirm branch state:
   - `git status -sb`
   - `git log --oneline origin/<branch>..HEAD`
2. Validate that each unpushed commit is purpose-coherent.
3. If worktree is clean and commit stack is intentional, push once:
   - `git push origin <branch>`
4. After push, confirm divergence is cleared:
   - `git status -sb`

## Rollback-safety add-on (non-destructive)

Use when a grouped commit needs correction without history rewrite:

1. Prefer additive fix commits over destructive undo.
2. For partial corrections, stage explicit paths and commit a focused follow-up.
3. For full content reversal on shared branches, use `git revert <commit>` (avoid reset/force flows unless explicitly requested).
4. Re-run hygiene preflight to ensure no accidental carryover remains.

## Guardrails

- Do not rewrite or revert unrelated user changes.
- Do not force-push or run destructive reset flows.
- Local Git writes are fine in this repo (`git add`, `git commit`, `git switch`, `git branch`); keep `git push` manual and separately approved.
- Keep generated churn in separate commits from logic/docs changes.
- If uncertain whether a file is scratch or real, ask before excluding.

**Commit grouping reminder:** split by intent first, then by destination; keep local scratch dirs in `.git/info/exclude` unless the operator asks for a tracked ignore.

**Push-prep quick check:** `git status -sb` then `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` before `git push origin main`.

**Rollback-safe default:** prefer follow-up fix commits or `git revert` on shared branches; avoid reset/force unless explicitly requested.
