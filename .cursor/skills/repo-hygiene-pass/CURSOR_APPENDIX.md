**Commit grouping reminder:** split by intent first, then by destination; keep local scratch dirs in `.git/info/exclude` unless the operator asks for a tracked ignore.

**Push-prep quick check:** `git status -sb` then `git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD` before `git push origin main`.

**Rollback-safe default:** prefer follow-up fix commits or `git revert` on shared branches; avoid reset/force unless explicitly requested.
