# Work-jiang ingest fallback (rate limit path)

**Preferred activation (operator):** say **`jiang ingest fallback`**.

Use this skill when ingesting a new lecture and the normal channel-wide transcript refresh is blocked (for example, repeated `429 Too Many Requests` during fetch), but you still need to complete a clean, auditable ingest now.

## When to run

- New lecture ingest is blocked by rate limits during full channel fetch.
- Episode metadata is known (title + video id), but local index is stale.
- You want a narrow fallback that preserves normal ingest and validation steps.

## Workflow

1. **Capture transcript input**
   - Save operator transcript text to an intake file under your work-jiang intake area.
   - Keep the transcript source explicit so ingest provenance is clear.

2. **Avoid brittle full-channel retries**
   - If full refresh is returning repeated `429` or hanging, stop it.
   - Switch to a targeted single-episode path rather than looping retries.

3. **Create a minimal local index override**
   - Write a one-row markdown index table with: `video_id`, title, and canonical watch URL.
   - This lets `ingest_lecture.py` resolve episode metadata without waiting on channel refresh.

4. **Run ingest with explicit override**
   - Execute `ingest_lecture.py` for the intended series/episode with:
     - `--file` for transcript input
     - `--index` pointing at the local one-row override
     - `--asr` when transcript normalization is desired
   - Confirm the target lecture file path and heading printed by the ingest command.

5. **Run post-ingest validators**
   - Execute work-jiang validators used in your lane.
   - Confirm metadata and dashboard artifacts regenerate without errors.

6. **Report and classify changed files**
   - Separate core ingest artifacts (lecture + metadata/status updates) from temporary fallback intake files.
   - Recommend whether to keep or drop the temporary local index override before commit.

## Guardrails

- Do not treat fallback index files as canonical source registry.
- Do not skip validation just because ingest succeeded.
- Keep commits focused: exclude unrelated local noise from the ingest commit.
- This is WORK-lane operational tooling, not Record merge flow.

## Command skeleton (adapt to host repo)

```bash
# Optional normal attempt (can be skipped if known rate-limited)
python3 scripts/fetch_youtube_channel_transcripts.py --channel "<channel-url>" --output-dir "<output-dir>" --resume

# Fallback ingest with explicit local index
python3 scripts/work_jiang/ingest_lecture.py <series> <episode> \
  --file <intake-transcript-path> \
  --index <local-one-row-index-path> \
  --asr

# Validation block (trim only if lane policy allows)
python3 scripts/work_jiang/validate_work_jiang.py --require-analysis-frontmatter
python3 scripts/work_jiang/validate_argument_layer.py
python3 scripts/work_jiang/validate_comparative_layer.py
```
