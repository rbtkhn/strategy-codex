# work-jiang — grace-mar

Operator project — **Jiang** (separate from SKILLS). See [skill-think](skill-think.md), [skill-write](skill-write.md), [work-alpha-school](work-alpha-school.md).

## Purpose

**Deliver a book and/or website** under the multivolume title **Predictive History** (one volume per primary corpus—lecture series for Volumes I–V; **Volume VI — Interviews** for long-form dialogue on any channel) that articulates and analyzes **Jiang’s unique philosophy** — clear enough for readers to understand the system, and analytic enough to show how claims connect and where they meet the world. Current repo tranche: **Volume 1 — Geo-Strategy**.

**Canonical library index:** The book is catalogued in [self-library](self-library.md) as **LIB-0149** (SELF-LIBRARY is reference-facing; the working manuscript and research corpus stay under `research/external/work-jiang/` until material is merged through the gate).

**Design lens:** Alpha-style mastery vocabulary (gates, “no Swiss cheese,” 2-hour pacing) mapped to this fork’s gate and WORK tools — [alpha-mastery-adaptation.md](../../docs/alpha-mastery-adaptation.md).

**Authorized sources (operator list):** [work-jiang-sources.md](../../docs/skill-work/work-jiang/work-jiang-sources.md) — convention: [work-modules-sources-principle.md](../../docs/skill-work/work-modules-sources-principle.md).

**Cursor skill — forward lecture chain:** [skill-jiang.md](../../docs/skill-work/work-jiang/skill-jiang.md) (predict next episode from prefix only; Volume IV bake-off log under `prediction-tracking/`).

**Publishing (serial releases, one repo):** [PUBLISHING.md](../../research/external/work-jiang/book/PUBLISHING.md) — ship **one volume at a time**; assume readers **may have prior volumes**; **cross-volume references** allowed; **all corpora** stay in `research/external/work-jiang/`.

**Method (operator work, not Voice knowledge until merged through the gate):**

1. **Lecture transcripts** — primary text: systematic capture and close reading of his talks (e.g. channel pulls under `research/external/youtube-channels/predictive-history/`), tagged and excerpted for themes, definitions, and internal consistency.
2. **[CIV-MEM](../../docs/skill-work/work-civ-mem/README.md)** — civilizational / strategic / governance vocabulary and frames from the civilization_memory stewardship lane: use as an **analytic lattice** (conditions, seams, multi-perspective structure) to organize and stress-test philosophical claims without collapsing them into politics alone.
3. **Current-events scans** — periodic passes (news, briefs, operator skills such as pulse/search workflows) to **ground** the philosophy: where the abstract system meets concrete episodes, and what would need to be said in a given moment.
4. **Compressions** — After a large artifact or handoff, run `python3 scripts/jiang-compress.py -u grace-mar` to emit a labeled JSON pack under `research/external/work-jiang/compressions/` (operator checklist + optional gate stub; not Record). See [COMPRESSION-ENGINE](../../docs/skill-work/work-jiang/COMPRESSION-ENGINE.md).

Nothing in this file is Record truth for the Voice until merged through the gated pipeline. Human-gated.

**Membrane (normative):** [research/external/work-jiang/README.md § Boundaries](../../research/external/work-jiang/README.md#boundaries-membrane) — research corpus vs Record, candidates vs quotes, validators as gate.

**Repo CI:** PRs that only touch work-jiang paths should use label **`lane/work-jiang`**. When pasting into `recursion-gate.md`, use the canonical **`### CANDIDATE-*`** block shape (see [work-jiang lane + gate CI](../../docs/skill-work/work-jiang/LANE-CI.md)).

## Context objectives

- Maintain a **canonical transcript set** and a working **outline / thesis map** for the book or site.
- Run **civ-mem-informed analysis** on clusters of transcript material (themes, tensions, dependencies).
- Run **current-events tie-ins** as optional chapters or “applications” sections — never shipped without explicit approval.
- Separate **exposition** (what Jiang’s philosophy holds) from **analysis** (how it compares, where it strains, what it predicts).

## Instance work context (YAML)

Machine-oriented snapshot for scripts and agents — [skills-modularity](../../../docs/skills-modularity.md) §2a (*Instance work context*). Not Record. Optional: `python3 scripts/work_jiang/update_work_jiang_lane.py --write` refreshes `status` from book metadata.

<!-- work_jiang.context.yaml WORK_JIANG_CONTEXT_V1 -->
```yaml
status: OUTLINE_ACTIVE
edge: "Philosophy book + site; transcript-driven; civ-mem lattice; current-events grounding"
gaps: []
notes: "See research/external/work-jiang/STATUS.md and BOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md for live production state. Geo-Strategy series resumed 2026-03-23; geo-13+ pending ingest."
```
<!-- /work_jiang.context.yaml WORK_JIANG_CONTEXT_V1 -->

## WORK GOALS

Objectives for this lane. Gated; evidence-linked when captured.

```yaml
work_goals:
  near_term: []
  horizon:
    - "Published book and/or website articulating Jiang's philosophy with transcript-backed analysis"
  source: null
```

---

## LIFE MISSION REF

Life mission lives in SELF (identity, values). WORK goals may align when this lane touches the companion.

```yaml
life_mission_ref: "self.md § VI VALUES (life_mission)"
```

---

## Operator schedule (Jiang lane)

- **Lecture series order (Predictive History / book work):** (1) **Geo-Strategy** — curated in `research/external/work-jiang/lectures/` (`geo-strategy-*.md`). (2) **Civilization** — second series; **transcript intake in progress** — add curated files as `civilization-*.md`, register `civ-*` sources in `metadata/sources.yaml`, same pipeline as Geo-Strategy ([WORKFLOW-transcripts.md](../../research/external/work-jiang/WORKFLOW-transcripts.md) § Multi-series; channel pulls under `research/external/youtube-channels/predictive-history/`).

## RESEARCH / ARTIFACTS

Repo-local material (operator research; not Voice knowledge until merged):

- [work-jiang (research)](../../research/external/work-jiang/README.md) — curated lecture notes + transcripts
  - [Transcript intake & analysis workflow](../../research/external/work-jiang/WORKFLOW-transcripts.md) — acquire, normalize, structured extraction, CIV-MEM passes, memo template
