# work-dev workspace

> **Mirror (work-cici):** Copied from canonical [`docs/archive/skill-work-legacy/work-dev/workspace.md`](../work-dev/workspace.md) for advisor sync. **Unlinked** filenames in the table below are still paths under `docs/archive/skill-work-legacy/work-dev/` in the grace-mar tree. **Clickable** links are adjusted for this folder.

Canonical operator entrypoint for the `work-dev` territory.

Use this file when you want one place to understand:

- what parts of the Grace-Mar â†” OpenClaw integration are real today
- what is only documented or aspirational
- where provenance or observability is weak
- how the territory could become a real business
- what should be checked next

## Related territory: template sync (not OpenClaw)

**[`work-companion-self`](../../work-companion-self/README.md)** â€” grace-mar â†” companion-self drift, `template_diff.py`, manifest audits, upstream PRs. Use that folder for **template governance**; use **this** folder for **OpenClaw / exports / continuity / CI**. See also [MERGING-FROM-COMPANION-SELF](../../../merging-from-companion-self.md).

## Current state summary

| Area | Current state |
|------|---------------|
| **Identity export** | Implemented through `integrations/openclaw_hook.py` and the runtime bundle export path |
| **Stage-only handback** | Implemented through `integrations/openclaw_stage.py` â†’ `/stage` |
| **Pipeline-level export audit** | Implemented via `runtime_compat_export` events and harness events |
| **Constitution advisory event** | Implemented via `intent_constitutional_critique` event emission |
| **End-to-end provenance** | Implemented: OpenClaw payload (source=openclaw_stage) flows as staging_meta into gate; candidate blocks carry candidate_source, artifact_*, constitution_*; recursion_gate_review parses them for review/benchmarks |
| **Session continuity** | **Contract:** [session-continuity-contract.md](../../work-dev/session-continuity-contract.md) â€” files + `continuity_read_log.py` + CI (`tests/test_continuity_read_log.py`); not â€œagent remembers.â€ Live JSONL append when script invoked; OpenClaw startup wiring still operator-side |

## Operator path

0. When debugging agent vs repo behavior, read `agentic-environment-principles.md` (environment before prompt).
1. Open `integration-status.md` to see what is implemented, partial, or only documented.
2. Read `known-gaps.md` before assuming a workflow is operational.
3. Use `provenance-checklist.md` when validating export, handback, or merge-followthrough behavior.
4. Check `economic-benchmarks.md` before claiming observability or benchmark coverage.
5. Update `integration-status.md` and `known-gaps.md` after any real test or implementation change.

## Business layer

This territory now has three lanes:

| Lane | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Doctrine** | Why the territory exists and what it believes about portable, governed AI systems |
| **Operator** | What is real today, what is partial, and what needs verification |
| **Business** | What the future company would sell, to whom, and how delivery could work |

Use the business lane when the question is not "is this implemented?" but "how could this become a client-services company?"

Crypto belongs adjacent to these lanes as a future **authority / settlement / access** layer, not as a prerequisite for current operator work.

## Current blockers

| Blocker | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| ~~**Handback provenance is not preserved cleanly into `recursion-gate.md`**~~ | Resolved: OpenClaw payload sets candidate_source + artifact/constitution fields in gate (handback_server + core + recursion_gate_review). |
| **Benchmark docs overstate current instrumentation** | Mitigated: `economic-benchmarks.md` distinguishes automatic pipeline emission vs manual/derivation; re-audit after hook changes |
| **Live continuity JSONL is opt-in** | CI verifies script + files; `scripts/openclaw_session_continuity.sh` logs then execs the command; habit still required if not wired into OpenClaw |

## Next actions

1. ~~Preserve OpenClaw-specific provenance end-to-end from `openclaw_stage.py` through `/stage` into staged candidates.~~ Done.
2. ~~Mark benchmark rows as instrumented, manual, planned, or blocked instead of implying they all exist today.~~ Done (see `economic-benchmarks.md` definitions and tables).
3. ~~CI wiring for `continuity_read_log.py`~~ Done (`tests/test_continuity_read_log.py`). ~~Optional: OpenClaw startup wrapper~~ `scripts/openclaw_session_continuity.sh` appends JSONL then runs the rest of the command.
4. ~~Refresh stale derived exports (`manifest.json`, `llms.txt`, `intent_snapshot.json`, `fork-manifest.json`, PRP, runtime bundle). Validator flags these; run `refresh_derived_exports.py` after confirming no Record changes are pending.~~ Done (2026-04-12: `refresh_derived_exports.py -u grace-mar`; commit `3a17caf`).
5. Close BUILD-AI-GAP-005 (factorial scenario library) or BUILD-AI-GAP-006 (reasoning vs action handback) â€” both `partial`; pick whichever unblocks the next real integration test.
6. OB1 chunking spike â€” when demand materializes: export one real `self.md` under each strategy, measure retrieval precision, pick the winner. Blocking prerequisite for the bridge exporter (PR 4). See `docs/integrations/ob1/architecture.md` Â§ Known technical risks.
7. Apply risk-mitigation template (success criteria, sustainment, deprecation, scope creep) to remaining uncovered territories: `work-politics`, `work-civ-mem`, `work-cici`. Template: `docs/archive/skill-work-legacy/work-template/README.md` Â§ Risk-mitigation checklist.

This workspace is for operator truth, not marketing truth. If a capability is only documented, say so plainly.
