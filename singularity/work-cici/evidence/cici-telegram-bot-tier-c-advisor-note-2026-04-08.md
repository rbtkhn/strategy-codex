# Cici Telegram bot — Tier C and injected memory (advisor note, WORK)

**Captured:** 2026-04-08  
**Territory:** work-cici **evidence** — operator coaching; not Cici’s Record; not a gate merge.

## Advisor note (one paragraph)

The Telegram Edge Function’s **pre-response MCP `search`** (query = user message, small result cap, snippets concatenated into the **system** prompt next to `CICI_SYSTEM`) is the right *shape* for continuity, but it inherits the same epistemic class as every other **vector / MCP recall** path already called out in Cici’s companion layer: **Tier C** — useful **context**, not **verified** business or partner truth. Treat injected lines as **“might help, might be wrong, might be stale”** in coaching: encourage Xavier to add **one machine-obvious sentence** inside `CICI_SYSTEM` (or the injected block header) that tells the model to **quote or summarize memories as uncertain recall**, to **prefer abstention** on BrewMind facts unless Tier A/B, and never to **elevate** a retrieved line into a **public promise** without governed promotion — otherwise the bot will feel *smarter* while quietly **confident-wrong** on the channel where shame and screenshot risk are highest.
