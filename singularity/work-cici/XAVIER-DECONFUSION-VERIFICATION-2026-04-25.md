# Xavier Deconfusion Verification (2026-04-25)

## Scope checked

- `rbtkhn/cici-ai`: `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `docs/personal/README.md`, `docs/seed-phase.md`, `docs/setup-guide.md`, `docs/governed-state-doctrine.md`
- grace-mar `work-cici` first-wave files: `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `LANES.md`, `SYNC-DAILY.md`, `POST-RENAME-AUDIT.md`, inventory docs

## Results

### cici-ai targeted active files

- `rg` on the targeted file set returns **no active `Xavier/xavier` hits** outside explicit legacy notes in historical context.
- Top-level identity and operator guidance now read Cici-first.

### grace-mar first-wave files

- `README.md`, `INDEX.md`, `LANES.md`, and `SYNC-DAILY.md` are Cici-first with explicit **Legacy note: formerly Xavier** fencing.
- Remaining `Xavier` mentions in the first-wave set are classified as:
  - legacy continuity labels (`work-xavier`, template path `xavier/`)
  - immutable historical audit references in `POST-RENAME-AUDIT.md`
  - compatibility names for scripts/files that remain intentionally unchanged

## Drift guard

- `python3 scripts/check_work_cici_drift.py` => **pass** (exit 0)

## Remaining legacy references by category

| Category | Examples | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Legacy continuity labels | `work-xavier`, `xavier/`, `formerly Xavier` | Allowed |
| Compatibility filenames | `xavier-instance-two-step.md`, `build_xavier_handbook_bundle.py` | Allowed |
| Historical audits/logs | `POST-RENAME-AUDIT.md` table and validation notes | Allowed |
| Immutable evidence/source names | external handles/titles, archived captures | Allowed |

## Conclusion

The first-wave implementation is complete: active-state language is Cici-first in both scopes, and retained Xavier references are fenced to legacy/compatibility/history containers.
