# Lecture forward chain — Volume IV **BLIND** runs (mechanical)

**Operator lane — not Record.** Each round uses [`scripts/work_jiang/forward_chain_blind_bundle.py`](../../../scripts/work_jiang/forward_chain_blind_bundle.py): **`bundle`** → prediction file in `scratch/` (gitignored) → **`reveal`**. This file is the **committed** audit; raw bundle + prediction drafts may live only under `scratch/`.

**See also:** Retrospective / narrative log [`lecture-forward-chain-gt-01-18.md`](lecture-forward-chain-gt-01-18.md) (not a substitute for blind evidence). **Machine tail:** [`registry/lecture-forward-chain-blind.jsonl`](registry/lecture-forward-chain-blind.jsonl).

## Blind round 1 — predict gt-02 (K=1)

**Date:** 2026-04-08  
**Bundle:** `prediction-tracking/scratch/gt-prefix-1.md` (`bundle --prefix-end 1`)  
**Prediction artifact:** `prediction-tracking/scratch/gt-predict-2.md` (required before `reveal`)  
**Reveal:** `reveal --episode 2 --require-prediction-path …/gt-predict-2.md`

### Prediction packet (as filed)

- **H1:** School / education as next life example (med) — stakeholder / incentives; student audience after dating example.
- **H2:** Family / household game (low).
- **H3:** Economics / first job (low).

### Resolution (gt-02)

- **Actual:** **Why Schools Suck** — stakeholder analysis of schools; literacy vs incentives; superstructure link.

### Scores

- **H1:** **hit**
- **H2:** miss
- **H3:** miss

### Adjustment (mergeable)

- Keep weight on **explicit student-life bridge** after a **survey + one worked example** cold open; next round re-check whether #2 promised “more examples from your life” in transcript tail (if bundle includes full transcript).

## Blind round 2 — predict gt-03 (K=2)

**Date:** 2026-04-08  
**Bundle:** `prediction-tracking/scratch/gt-prefix-2.md` (`bundle --prefix-end 2`)  
**read_depth:** full (bundle as written)  
**Prediction artifact:** `prediction-tracking/scratch/gt-predict-3.md`  
**Reveal:** `reveal --episode 3 --require-prediction-path …/gt-predict-3.md`

### Prediction packet (as filed)

- **H1 (med):** Success / class / parenting / mobility — schools + dating set up “who wins life”; next is **individual vs structural** success myths.
- **H2 (low):** Immigration or cross-border mobility — elite/migration undertones after mobility talk.
- **H3 (low):** Workplace / first-job game — life-course after school.
- **Falsifiers:** H1 wrong if lecture is purely macro-IR; H2 wrong if no migration frame.

### Resolution (gt-03 revealed)

# Game Theory #3: Rich Dad, Poor Dad
**Topic:** Success, class structure, parenting strategies, and social mobility under game theory.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- Reviews mainstream success theories (delay of gratification, growth mindset, deliberate practice) and reframes them through structural constraints.
- Contrasts rich/poor parenting environments and argues behavior differences are rational responses to different social games.
- Links elite overproduction and blocked social mobility to instability, revolution, and historical game-reset dynamics.


### Scores

- **H1:** **hit**
- **H2:** miss
- **H3:** miss

### Adjustment (mergeable)

Mobility lecture sets up class/success frame; watch for cross-border next.

### Replay (hand-written packet — closed-loop validation)

**Date:** 2026-04-06  
**Note:** `gt-prefix-2.md` regenerated after `advance --completed-round 1` + `bundle --closed-loop`; `gt-predict-3.md` replaced with hypotheses from the **prefix bundle only** (not the batch template).

#### Prediction packet (as filed, replay)

- **H1 (med):** Work / internship / first-job game after school ranking and stakeholder critique.
- **H2 (med):** Parenting + class / intergenerational strategy (bridges mating investment and institutional shaping of kids).
- **H3 (low):** University / admissions / credential tournament.
- **H4 (low):** Money, consumption, or rich vs poor life scripts — economics as student-relatable frame before hard macro.

#### Scores

- **H1:** miss
- **H2:** hit
- **H3:** miss
- **H4:** hit

#### Adjustment (mergeable)

After **schools + stakeholders**, **parenting × class × success myths** is as plausible a third lecture as **workplace**; keep **both branches** in the fan until one path double-falsifies. When the corpus allows **pop success / finance memes** in the title, **explicit money + class** hypotheses (here **H4**) are load-bearing, not only “macro IR next.”

- **H2 (low):** Financial literacy / investing mechanics — “rich dad” literal continuation.
- **H3 (low):** University / admissions tournament.
- **Falsifiers:** H1 wrong if lecture stays US-only abstraction without groups.

### Resolution (gt-04 revealed)

# Game Theory #4: The Immigration Trap
**Topic:** Immigration, group strategy, status competition, and demographic game dynamics.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- Compares immigrant outcomes across groups and critiques school/test-score narratives as incomplete explanations.
- Argues status power and group strategy can dominate individual achievement in migration contexts.
- Frames immigration as a long-cycle game tied to demographics, cohesion, and rule-setting power.


### Scores

- **H2:** miss
- **H3:** miss

### Adjustment (mergeable)

After success + institutions in schools, group-outcome migration is a strong pivot.

#### Adjustment (mergeable)

When **class + blocked mobility** dominate the prefix, **group-boundary pivot** (immigration, minority outcomes) can beat **workplace** for the next episode; keep finance-sequel as low unless title cues pop finance.

#### miss_taxonomy (replay)

**Topic:** Cycles of state rise/fall via energy, openness, cohesion, and changing game structures.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- Proposes a civilizational cycle model where marginal groups with higher cohesion eventually displace wealthy cores.
- Interprets imperial politics as shifting game types: cooperation, hierarchy, factional competition, and outsider capture.
- Uses historical case studies to argue that adaptability and group structure matter more than initial resource endowments.

# Game Theory #10: The Law of Asymmetry
**Topic:** Law of asymmetry: empire vs underdog, US–Iran war framing, strategy as feedback into energy, openness, cohesion.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- Formalizes a “law of asymmetry”: apparent imperial strengths (mass, organization, depth of loss tolerance) invert over time into weaknesses.
- Maps US advantages (technology, propaganda, money) and Iranian advantages (faith, terrain, nationalism) to how each can backfire.

- **Falsifiers:** H1 wrong if no systemic transition thesis.

### Resolution (gt-15 revealed)

# Game Theory #15: The Return of History
**Topic:** End of Fukuyama’s “end of history,” decay of Pax Americana pillars, and a resilience-first forecast of the post-unipolar world.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- Reframes the US–Iran war as symptom of unipolar-order exhaustion (military hubris, scientism-as-orthodoxy, dollar corrosion).
- Argues the successor era prioritizes resilience over efficiency: spirituality, community, and intergenerational power transfer.
- Maps energy, trade, demography, migration, and regional blocs as stress vectors with explicit scenario claims for the next decades.


### Scores

- **H1:** **hit**
- **H2:** miss

# Game Theory #16: Pax Judaica Rising
**Topic:** Endgame scenarios for the US-Iran war, strategic layers (narrative/political/economic/military), US military-industrial constraints, and a Pax Judaica transition thesis.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- Frames the war as a structural contest over imperial replacement and control of postwar trade/energy architecture.
- Contrasts US strategy (forcing narrative/political/economic layers to fit military goals) with Iran's adaptive reverse strategy.
- Argues US constraints (political will, manufacturing limits, casualty aversion) create an opening for Israeli regional primacy.

**Reveal:** `reveal --episode 17 --require-prediction-path …/gt-predict-17.md`

### Prediction packet (as filed)

- **H1 (low/med):** **Reset / world order / institutions** — ambiguous title risk; macro money or Davos frame.
- **H2 (med):** **US leadership / Trump**-era order naming — follows Pax + war.
- **H3 (low):** Ceasefire diplomacy.
- **Falsifiers:** TBD At a glance in corpus — lean on title + position.

### Resolution (gt-17 revealed)

# Game Theory #17: The Great Reset
**Topic:** TBD — one-paragraph summary after listen.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- TBD after listen.


### Scores

- **H1:** **hit** (title + reset/world-order frame; corpus **Topic** / **At a glance** still TBD)
- **H2:** miss (Trump-era naming not in title)
- **H3:** miss

### Adjustment (mergeable)

**Prediction artifact:** `prediction-tracking/scratch/gt-predict-18.md`  
**Reveal:** `reveal --episode 18 --require-prediction-path …/gt-predict-18.md`

### Prediction packet (as filed)

- **H1 (med):** **Trump / US world order capstone** — leadership + commodities + war outcome bundle.
- **H2 (low):** Pure commodity markets.
- **H3 (low):** Meta recap / Q&A only.
- **Falsifiers:** H1 wrong if no US leadership frame.

### Resolution (gt-18 revealed)

# Game Theory #18: Trump World Order
**Topic:** US–Iran war rhetoric vs. escalation signals; “Greater North America” / Monroe-style consolidation; resource-realignment and Treasury-dependence logic; contrarian “engineered collapse” and Trump World Order vs. Bush’s New World Order; Q&A on structural economic decline and multi-lens prediction.

**At a glance (excerpt):**
- Contrasts allied leaders’ “pain ahead” messaging with Trump’s confident war-continuation and “Stone Ages” framing as a possible inverse signal (war not going to plan).
- Surveys invasion rumors, Hormuz control difficulty, troop levels, and three informal “imminent operation” indicators (Pizza Index, Pentagon-area social patterns, Polymarket-style large bets).
- Introduces a resource-realignment thesis: disrupting Middle East supply could push buyers toward North American / Russian energy and related commodities, with maps logic on fertilizer and water.
- Poses a deliberate-collapse / “lose to win” contrarian frame versus conventional “failed president” narratives; compares Bush 1991 New World Order pillars to an inverted “Trump World Order.”
- Q&A ties structural postwar financial architecture to elite competition and asks how geopolitics connects to earlier religious/eschatological lecture threads.


### Scores
