## 1. Scope (kickoff — edit when you start a pass)

| Field | Your choice |
|-------|-------------|
| **Series** | `geo-strategy`, `secret-history` |
| **Depth** | **B** — all in-scope episodes, targeted signals only |
| **Session / date** | 2026-03-24 |

**Passes complete:**
- Geo-Strategy, depth B, 20 episodes (geo-strategy-01 through -20).
- Secret History, depth B, **28** verbatim ASR-derived `## Full transcript` episodes (secret-history-01 through -28): normalized where run, manually audited, pytest green.
- Secret History Volume III transcript ingest: **complete** (no further verbatim paste queue for SH01–28).

---

## 2. Preconditions (check before auditing)

- [x] **Raw captions:** 20/20 geo-strategy `.txt` fetched via `--input geo-strategy-urls.txt --resume` (2026-03-24).
- [x] **Coverage report:** `check_asr_audit_preconditions.py --only-glob 'geo-strategy-*'` → 20 scanned, 20 found, 0 missing.
- [x] **Tooling sanity:** `pytest tests/test_normalize_lecture_transcript_asr.py -q` → 10 passed (2026-03-24).
- [x] **Secret History raw coverage:** `check_asr_audit_preconditions.py --only-glob 'secret-history-*'` → 28 scanned, 28 raw `.txt` found, 0 missing.
- [x] **Verbatim diff layer:** `sync_verbatim_transcripts.py --write --only-glob 'geo-strategy-*'` → 20 written, 0 missing raw. Series detected as `geo-strategy` (common tier only).
- [ ] **Jiang fingerprint (optional, read-only):** [JIANG-LECTURE-FINGERPRINT.md](JIANG-LECTURE-FINGERPRINT.md) scaffold present but not populated.

## 3. Targeted verification (what to actually check)

Do **not** proofread entire transcripts unless depth **C** or a chapter requires it. **Do** verify when any of these apply ([ASR-VERIFICATION-RUBRIC.md](ASR-VERIFICATION-RUBRIC.md) § Targeted verification):

| Signal | Checked? (episode list or “all in scope”) |
|--------|-------------------------------------------|
| Proper names, non-English, book titles | All 20 geo-strategy episodes |
| Numbers, dates, counts | All 20 geo-strategy episodes |
| Direct attribution / pull-quotes | All 20 geo-strategy episodes |
| Sensitive or high-liability lines | All 20 geo-strategy episodes |

**Compare:** raw `.txt` ↔ `verbatim-transcripts/<slug>.md` (if generated) ↔ `lectures/<slug>.md` (`## Full transcript` if present) ↔ quote candidates you intend to promote to `metadata/quotes.yaml`.

**Geo-Strategy invariant:** never treat civilization-only ASR fixes as automatic for geo (e.g. “thieves” vs Thebes) — see tests and `asr_light_clean.py`.

### Highest-impact patterns

- **Proper names** (~70% of findings): Soleimani, Netanyahu, Khamenei, Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz, Bretton Woods, Strait of Hormuz each garbled across multiple episodes.
- **Number errors** (order-of-magnitude): "45 million" for "4–5 million" (geo-10), "133%" for "13%" (geo-03), "$1 13 billion" for "$13 billion" (geo-08), "20120" for "2020" (geo-05, -07).
- **Meaning-altering substitutions**: "deification" for "de-Baathification" (geo-06, -13), "World War II" for "III" (geo-14), "strategic death" for "depth" (geo-13), "theism" for "deism" (geo-03, -11), "succeeded" for "seceded" (geo-11).
- **Cross-episode inconsistency**: geo-17/-18 less thoroughly curated than geo-19/-20 — same terms fixed in later episodes but garbled in earlier ones.
- **Geo-19 cleanest**: zero findings — thoroughly curated.
- **Geo-07 and geo-08 densest**: Iranian and ancient Greek proper names severely corrupted.

### Secret History highest-impact patterns

- **Philosophical vocabulary** (~40% of findings): noumena, eudaimonia, Gnosticism, synchronicity, monotheism, polytheistic — ASR struggles with Greek/Latin philosophical terms.
- **Proper names** (~35%): Kant, Spengler, Piketty, Hegel, Dante, Leonidas, Phoenicians, Carthaginians — similar to geo-strategy and civilization patterns.
- **Medical/policy terms** (~15%): euthanasia (5+ garbled forms in SH03 alone), moratorium, healthcare.
- **SH04 densest:** 24 substitutions — heavy philosophical and ancient Greek content.
- **SH01 second densest:** 16 substitutions — Kant, eudaimonia, monotheism cluster.

### Secret History candidate replacements

SH01–04: 62 automated substitutions via 53 entries (2026-03-24). SH11: +12 `COMMON_REPLACEMENTS` tuples (vine/divine phrases, Petzinger, Van Gogh, Micronesia, Darwin phrases). SH12: +11 tuples. SH13: in-file only (no new tuples). SH14: in-file only (no new tuples; “steps”→steppes not automated). SH15: in-file only (no new tuples). SH16: in-file only (no new tuples; Greek epic name density too high for blind automation). SH17: in-file only (no new tuples; “Job”→Joab and Uriah clusters too context-sensitive for blind automation). SH18: in-file only (no new tuples; Ahura Mazda / Zarathustra string density too high for blind automation). SH19: in-file only (no new tuples; Qin/Qing and Levant/Biblical proper-name density too high for blind automation). SH20: in-file only (no new tuples; “the way” vs Wei / Thebes vs thieves too context-sensitive for blind automation). SH21: in-file only (no new tuples; Cannae/historian-name homophones and Livy quotation density too high for blind automation). SH22: in-file only (no new tuples; Jesus/Dante/Dostoevsky proper-name density + `Beatric` substring hazard). SH23: in-file only (no new tuples; Paul/circumcision/Pilate homophone clusters). SH24: in-file only (no new tuples; Byzantine/Sassanid/Nicaea Qur’an-read-aloud density + “assassin”→Sassanid context hazard). SH25: in-file only (no new tuples; Milgram/Protestant/merchant-oligarchy dense proper names + “capital” vs “Capitol” homophone hazard). SH26: in-file only (no new tuples; Jewish/Frankist proper-name density + “seductive”→Sadducees substring hazard + `Frank`/`Frankist`/`Francis` disambiguation). SH27: in-file only (no new tuples; British-philosophy + Russian-Revolution + *Coningsby* read-aloud density + `Frank`/`Frankist`/`Franks`/`Israeli`/`Disraeli` disambiguation). SH28: in-file only (no new tuples; finale density: Weishaupt/Illuminati variants + `Pax Judaica` homophone clusters + Koestler/Khazar read-aloud + Silicon Valley names + `Pax`/`pastor`/`pack` context disambiguation). All common tier; no secret-history-specific tier.

**Not automated (too risky for string replacement):**

| Term | ASR form(s) | Why skipped |
|------|------------|-------------|
| monad | "nomad", "Mona", "Monet", "Monach" | Real English words; would cause false positives |
| Geist | "gist", "guys" | Real English words |
| nous | "news" | Real English word |
| Kant | "Kai" | Real name |
| Dante | "Donna", "Donnie" | Real names |
| divine sun | "divine son" | Both are valid phrases; context-dependent |

### Secret History scope limitation

**SH01–28:** Verbatim `## Full transcript` ingest for Secret History Volume III is complete (2026-03-24). Further edits are editorial only (normalizer + targeted audit), not outline replacement.
