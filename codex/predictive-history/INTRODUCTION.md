# Introduction

The **Preface** explains why this book exists and how it treats evidence. This **Introduction** is the map: what claim the book advances, how **Part I** (twenty chapters) follows the **twenty Geo-Strategy lectures** in order, how each chapter ends with **registry-backed predictions**, and how **Part II** (after Chapter 20) analyzes those predictions as a set.

## Predictive History (series) and this volume

The umbrella title for the multivolume project is **Predictive History**. Each numbered volume corresponds to **one primary corpus**—usually a **lecture series**; **Volume VI** is **long-form interviews** with Jiang (any host or channel), still one chapter per session in upload order; **Volume VII** is **Essays** — the written newsletter published as **Predictive History** on Substack, ordered by publication date in the operator’s curated mirror—so readers can follow a single arc from exposition through analysis without mixing corpora. **This volume** is **Volume 1 — Geo-Strategy**; the chapter plan and evidence packs here refer to that series unless noted otherwise.

## The argument in brief

The book’s master claim is that Jiang’s philosophy is best understood as a **civilizational theory of formation, legitimacy, and strategic action**—not as isolated commentary on current events. Three threads run through the chapters:

1. **Formation** — Education and shared narrative are not optional trim; they shape who “we” are and what futures look imaginable.
2. **Empire and imagination** — Religious and quasi-religious imagination stay structurally entangled with how large-scale order is pictured and justified.
3. **Testability** — The framework implies expectations about history and the near future; those expectations can be tracked, compared, and revised.

Those threads correspond to the way the thesis map is developed in the evidence base: from formation and agency, through empire and metaphysics, to claims that invite scorecards and comparison with mainstream readings.

## How the book is organized

### Part I — One chapter per lecture (Chapters 1–20)

**Chapters 1–20** track **Geo-Strategy #1 through #20** in the same order as the classroom series. This volume is therefore **not** a “normal” survey history that hides the seams of teaching; it keeps Jiang’s **session-by-session arc**, examples, and cumulative argument. Chapter titles match the lecture titles (see the curated transcript files and canonical YouTube links in each chapter’s evidence pack).

Rough **shape within the series**: early lectures build **asymmetry, religion, empire, and election** threads; mid lectures turn toward **case studies, scenarios, Russia, America, and method**—including a **psychohistory** session on imagining the future; the **extended arc** (lectures 13–20) carries the **Iran-war escalation, game-theory methodology, messianic leadership, Newton/Christian-Zionism line, hybrid war, and civilizational-decline** themes through Volume I’s **finale** (lecture 20). Exposition and analysis **interleave** as they did in class.

**End-of-chapter predictions** — Each Part I chapter closes with **at least three** clearly stated predictions, identified by **`prediction_id`** in `prediction-tracking/registry/predictions.jsonl` and listed per chapter in `metadata/book-architecture.yaml`. See `CHAPTER-PREDICTION-BOX.md` for the boxed subsection template.

### Part II — Analyzing Jiang’s predictions (after Chapter 20)

**Part II** begins after the Geo-Strategy finale (Chapter 20). It does **not** introduce a new lecture corpus. It **evaluates** every prediction introduced in Part I using **deep web and news search**: time-stamped, citable reporting; **triangulation** across independent sources when the claim matters; and explicit treatment of **claim type** (event vs conditional vs trend vs interpretive—some rows stay pending or “not evaluable” without a metric). Conditionals are scored fairly (**antecedent** and **consequent** where relevant). Part II notes **tensions** between chapters, then delivers an **overall evaluation**: how well the lecture series’s forecasts held up as a set, and what evidence would change that verdict. Philosophy is not reduced to a ledger, but the ledger is made explicit.

**Consolidated Part II draft (all lectures, full registry):** [`book/PART-II-GEO-STRATEGY.md`](book/PART-II-GEO-STRATEGY.md) — master scorecard, cross-chapter evidence (e.g. June 2025 Iran escalation), and overall evaluation. Update the **as-of** date when re-running the news pass.

**Appendices**  
The appendices support **testability** without pretending to close every debate. One appendix focuses on **predictions** (what was claimed, what happened, what would update confidence). The other records **divergence from mainstream interpretations** so readers can see where this reading agrees with or departs from common narratives.

## How to read this book

- If you want **speed**, read **chapter 1** and **chapter 20** (Part I bookends), then read **Part II** for how predictions are scored, then skim the appendices.
- If you want **depth**, read **in lecture order** (Part I, chapters 1–20), note the prediction box at each chapter end, then read **Part II**, then use appendices as reference tools rather than a verdict.

Throughout, the book returns to the same discipline: **stay close to what each session actually argues**—and when it judges, do so with transcript-backed evidence and explicit criteria, not with applause or dismissal alone.

## Sister volume — Civilization (Volume II)

The **Civilization** lecture series is **Volume II** in the same multivolume line. Its **Part II** is **Divergence** (how claims compare to named scholarly or mainstream frames), **not** a prediction pass like Geo-Strategy Part II. Overview: [`book/VOLUME-II-CIVILIZATION.md`](book/VOLUME-II-CIVILIZATION.md); method: [`book/PART-II-CIVILIZATION-DIVERGENCE.md`](book/PART-II-CIVILIZATION-DIVERGENCE.md).

## Future volume — Secret History (Volume III)

**Secret History** is registered as **Volume III** in the Predictive History line. Scope, corpus boundaries, and Part II method are tracked in [`book/VOLUME-III-SECRET-HISTORY.md`](book/VOLUME-III-SECRET-HISTORY.md).

## Future volume — Game Theory (Volume IV)

**Game Theory** is registered as **Volume IV** in the Predictive History line. Lecture **sources** **#1–#16** are ingested in-repo (`gt-01`–`gt-16`); book Part I drafts, analysis files, chapter mapping, and Part II method are tracked in [`book/VOLUME-IV-GAME-THEORY.md`](book/VOLUME-IV-GAME-THEORY.md).

## Future volume — Great Books (Volume V)

**Great Books** is registered as **Volume V** in the Predictive History line. Scope, corpus boundaries, and Part II method are tracked in [`book/VOLUME-V-GREAT-BOOKS.md`](book/VOLUME-V-GREAT-BOOKS.md).

## Volume VI — Interviews (same book line)

**Interviews** is **Volume VI**: curated **long-form dialogue / Q&A** with Jiang on **any** show or channel, in **YouTube publication order**—the same **Predictive History** intellectual frame as the lecture volumes, with **one book chapter per interview** unless `metadata/source-map.yaml` documents an exception. Corpus keys, filenames, and registry wiring are in [`book/VOLUME-VI-INTERVIEWS.md`](book/VOLUME-VI-INTERVIEWS.md).

## Volume VII — Essays (written newsletter)

**Volume VII — Essays** is the **Predictive History** newsletter corpus: curated posts on [Predictive History (Substack)](https://predictivehistory.substack.com/), mirrored under `substack/essays/<slug>.md` for analysis and crosswalk to lectures. **Not** wired into `metadata/sources.yaml` by default. Scope, ordering, and analysis pattern are in [`book/VOLUME-VII-ESSAYS.md`](book/VOLUME-VII-ESSAYS.md).
