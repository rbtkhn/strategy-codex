## 9. Wisdom Questions (Optional)

- How did you sleep last night?
- What movement felt good today?
- What did you eat that made you feel strong?
- Do you want a lighter or more active lesson today?

## 10. Integration Notes

| Flow | Use |
|------|-----|
| Lesson prompts | Use sleep/movement data for intensity (e.g. lighter after low sleep); respect preferences. |
| Wisdom questions | Ask when Hannah opts in. No prescription. |
| Checkpoint reflections | Invitational only (e.g. “How did rest and movement go this week?”). |

**Guardrails:** Meet where they are (AGENTS rule 7). Companion-led. No prescription. Any new health-derived content for SELF/EVIDENCE goes through RECURSION-GATE.
