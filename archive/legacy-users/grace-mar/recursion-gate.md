# RECURSION GATE — grace-mar

> Staging file for the gated profile pipeline — **one queue per companion, every channel.**
> Writers include **Telegram**, **WeChat**, **operator/Cursor** (activity reports, `calibrate_from_miss`, `parse_we_did`), **Mini App** (when wired), and **test/harness** runs. Each candidate carries **`channel_key`** (e.g. `telegram:…`, `operator:cursor`, `test:…`) so you can see the source. **Same gate, same merge** — not Telegram-only.
>
> **Workflow (one gate):**
> 1. Review each candidate below
> 2. Change `status: pending` to `status: approved` or `status: rejected`
> 3. Tell the assistant: **"approve"** — the agent immediately processes approved candidates into self.md, self-evidence.md, session-log.md, and prompt.py. No separate "process the review queue" step.
>
> **Merge checklist (correctness before approve):**
> 1. **Grounded** — Tied to something the companion actually said or did (or artifact), not invented or world-knowledge leakage.
> 2. **Merge-ready** — Would you ship this to SELF/EVIDENCE without embarrassment? If it feels like filler or duplicate IX, reject or edit.
> 3. **No duplicate lane** — Same fact already in IX-A/B/C? Reject or fold into existing entry instead of piling candidates.
> 4. **Human pass** — If only the analyst saw the exchange, one quick re-read of `example_from_exchange` / source lines.
> 5. **Portability** — For `portable-working-identity` candidates, also check [portability review checklist](../../docs/portable-record/portability-review-checklist.md).
>
> **Review checklist** (legacy one-liner): Grounded in the exchange? No LLM inference beyond it? No contradiction with existing Record?
>
> **Intent (before approve — long agents / optimization framing):** Models optimize toward task completion; constraints must be explicit. Ask: (1) **What would I not want** even if this candidate "succeeds"? (2) **When should we stop and ask** the companion? (3) **If this conflicts with INTENT**, companion + INTENT win — reject or revise. See **design-notes §11.9** (Misalignment at the interface).
>
> Machine-written by **`archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/core.py`** (Telegram, WeChat, activity reports) and by **operator scripts** that stage here — only edit the `status` field (and optional rejection notes).
>
> **Territory (work-politics vs companion):** For **work-politics** candidates, set **`territory: work-politics`** or **`channel_key: operator:wap`** (optionally `operator:wap:brief-name`). Operator tools then filter: `python scripts/operator_blocker_report.py -u grace-mar --territory wap` (work-politics territory only) or `--territory companion` (Record only). Same file, different lens.
>
> **Invariant:** Every **pending** or **approved-not-yet-merged** candidate must sit **above** `## Processed`. The bot inserts new blocks immediately before `## Processed`. If anything pending appears below Processed, move it up or merge will not see it.

## Candidate classification (Comprehension Envelope)

Optional YAML keys on each `### CANDIDATE-…` fenced block. **Orthogonal** to traffic **`risk_tier`** (`quick_merge_eligible` / `review_batch` / `manual_escalate` from [recursion-gate-three-tier.md](../../docs/recursion-gate-three-tier.md) and [recursion_gate_review.py](../../scripts/recursion_gate_review.py)) — do **not** reuse `risk_tier` for a `low`/`medium`/`high` blast-radius ladder.

| Field | Values | Role |
|-------|--------|------|
| **`impact_tier`** | `low` \| `medium` \| `high` \| `boundary` | Blast radius / promotion sensitivity of **this** merge (content), not review traffic. |
| **`envelope_class`** | `none` \| `optional` \| `required` | Whether a **Comprehension Envelope** block is omitted, recommended, or required. |

**Intended pairing:** `low` → `none`; `medium` → `optional`; `high` or `boundary` → `required`. Full vocabulary: [comprehension-envelope-gate.md](../../docs/governance/comprehension-envelope-gate.md).

**Authority map (advisory):** When you can name a [surface key](../../docs/authority-map.md) for the change (e.g. `memory_governance`, `prepared_context`), run `python3 scripts/check-authority.py --surface <key> --json` for **recommended** `impact_tier`, `envelope_class`, and Reflection Gate label derived from write authority — not a substitute for judgment; companion may override in YAML.

**Optional check:** `python3 scripts/validate_gate_comprehension_envelope.py -u grace-mar` (warns if `envelope_class: required` but envelope missing; `--strict` exits non-zero).

### Comprehension Envelope template

Place **below** the closing YAML fence of the candidate block, still under the same `### CANDIDATE-…` section:

```markdown
### Comprehension Envelope
- What this is:
- Why this path:
- Why not the next-best option:
- Blast radius:
- Assumptions / fragile points:
- Human override applied:
```

**Authoring:** 1–2 sentences per bullet; name concrete surfaces; `unknown` allowed; no motivational filler; reviewer scannable in ~30 seconds.

### Examples (illustrative)

Not live candidates — copy the shape when adding real **pending** blocks above `## Processed`.

**Example A — low impact, no envelope**

```yaml
impact_tier: low
envelope_class: none
status: pending
# … other required candidate keys …
```

*(No `### Comprehension Envelope` block for this class.)*

**Example B — boundary impact, envelope required**

```yaml
impact_tier: boundary
envelope_class: required
status: pending
# … other required candidate keys …
```

```markdown
### Comprehension Envelope
- What this is: One IX-A line from a daily-brief claim already verified under Links with dated citations.
- Why this path: Knowledge belongs in SELF when stable; the brief was intake only.
- Why not the next-best option: Pasting the full brief into SELF would bloat IX-A; leaving it only in days.md would skip the Record.
- Blast radius: Single IX-A bullet; no prompt or abstention rule change.
- Assumptions / fragile points: Source may need refresh if the situation moves; companion may narrow wording on approve.
- Human override applied: none.
```

## Reflection Gates (v1)

**Reflection Gates** are a **process-control label** at the **promotion boundary** only. They scale how much deliberate review to apply; they do **not** change runtime generation or bot staging speed.

**Triggers use `impact_tier`**, not traffic **`risk_tier`**. Traffic tiers (`quick_merge_eligible` / `review_batch` / `manual_escalate`) remain the machine UX lane from [recursion-gate-three-tier.md](../../docs/recursion-gate-three-tier.md).

| Gate | When (`impact_tier`) | Comprehension Envelope | v1 enforcement |
|------|----------------------|------------------------|----------------|
| *(none)* | `low` or unset | `envelope_class: none` typical | Fast path; no extra friction |
| **Light Gate** | `medium` | `envelope_class: optional` (recommended) | **Advisory only** — no hard block if omitted early on; ~30s scan of purpose + blast radius (summary or envelope) |
| **Heavy Gate** | `high` or `boundary` | `envelope_class: required` | Envelope required; **Blast radius** and **Human override applied** bullets must be honestly filled (`unknown` ok). **Advisory-first** warnings from `validate_gate_comprehension_envelope.py`; optional `--strict` only where documented |

**Dynamic Gate** (observability-driven escalation) is **not** in v1 — reserved for a later PR.

**Optional acknowledgment (Heavy):** You may set `reflection_ack: heavy` on the candidate YAML when the companion has done an explicit Heavy Gate read (still one human approver in v1).

**Suggested YAML (Heavy example)**

```yaml
impact_tier: boundary
envelope_class: required
reflection_ack: heavy
# … status, summary, mind_category, profile_target, suggested_entry, …
```
