# LIBRARY — grace-mar

**Continuity boundary:** SELF-LIBRARY is the governed return-to reference layer. It is not the rotatable session/process buffer; that role belongs to [`self-memory.md`](self-memory.md). Add or reroute reference domains here only through the appropriate governed path; leave short-lived continuity, open loops, and session calibration in MEMORY.

A governed retrieval substrate for reference-facing knowledge. Active entries shape runtime lookup order (SELF-LIBRARY → CIV-MEM → full web); `scope` and `lookup_priority` steer which questions match which sources. Also preserves return-to references, canon works, and influential media. Not SELF-KNOWLEDGE — see [boundary](../../docs/boundary-self-knowledge-self-library.md).

**Cloned from companion-self** `users/_template/self-library.md` (2026-02-26). Grace-mar-specific entries (reference works, videos) appended. File renamed from library.md to self-library.md for consistency with self-* taxonomy.

**Schema:** [docs/library-schema.md](../../docs/library-schema.md)

**Contents:** [Operator analytical books](#operator-analytical-books) · [Bookshelf](#bookshelf) · [Entries](#entries) · [Theology](#theology) · [Physics, chemistry & biology](#physics-chemistry--biology) · [History](#history) · [Computer Science](#computer-science) · [Metadata](#metadata)

**Library-first preference:** [LIB-0149 — Predictive History](#operator-analytical-books) uses `lookup_priority: preferred` so it sorts **above** `high` in the analyst library summary (see [library-schema.md](../../docs/library-schema.md) · `lookup_priority`).

## Operator analytical books

**Purpose:** A named shelf for **operator-authored “books”** in grace-mar — structured corpora built for **analysis, judgment, and synthesis** (not third-party canon). Each has a canonical README under `docs/skill-work/` or `research/external/work-jiang/`; **`users/grace-mar/SELF-LIBRARY/`** may symlink the same tree for discoverability.

**How it works:** Entries use normal **lanes** and **`type: book`** ([library-schema.md](../../docs/library-schema.md)). Tag **`scope`** with **`operator_analytical`** plus territory tags (`work_jiang`, `work_strategy`, `work_cici`, `work_dev`, …). Nothing here bypasses the **gated pipeline** for companion-facing Record claims.

**History notebook (LIB-0156):** The **SELF-LIBRARY** index (governed entries) is the **curated fact base** for `hn-*` and civ-thread drafting; **CIV-MEM (LIB-0157)** remains the adjacent MEM-reservoir. See [History Notebook README](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/README.md).

| ID | Title | Canonical README |
|----|--------|-------------------|
| **LIB-0149** | Predictive History (work-jiang multivolume spine) | [`research/external/work-jiang/BOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../research/external/work-jiang/BOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| **LIB-0153** | Strategy notebook | [`docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/README.md`](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/README.md) |
| **LIB-0154** | Cici notebook | [`docs/skill-work/work-cici/cici-notebook/README.md`](../../docs/skill-work/work-cici/cici-notebook/README.md) |
| **LIB-0155** | Dev journal | [`docs/skill-work/work-dev/dev-notebook/work-dev/journal/README.md`](../../docs/skill-work/work-dev/dev-notebook/work-dev/journal/README.md) |

| **LIB-0159** | Theology notebook — define own beliefs through creating the book | [`docs/skill-work/work-strategy/theology-notebook/README.md`](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/theology-notebook/README.md) |
| **LIB-0157** | Civilization Memory (upstream repository) | Local: [`research/repos/civilization_memory/`](../../research/repos/civilization_memory/README.md) · symlink: [`SELF-LIBRARY/civilization_memory`](SELF-LIBRARY/civilization_memory) |

**Related (not on this shelf):** [LIB-0151](#entries) (YouTube transcript library) and [LIB-0152](#entries) (TCN curated transcript book) are **bundled channel books** — operator analytical, but listed under the YouTube subsection in **Entries**.

## Bookshelf

<a id="self-library-bookshelf"></a>
**self-library-bookshelf** is the operator’s name for this collection: **third-party books the operator physically owns**, cataloged as **`HNSRC-*`** in the machine SSOT. Same scope as **Bookshelf** / [LIB-0158](#bookshelf) below; use *self-library-bookshelf* when you want to stress **shelf** + **self-library** routing in one phrase.

**Purpose:** A **separate container** from [Operator analytical books](#operator-analytical-books). **Concept & contrast** (enhanced bibliography, not full text, not operator books): [`BOOKSHELF.md`](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/BOOKSHELF.md).

**Bookshelf** holds **third-party books the operator physically owns** — cataloged as **`HNSRC-*`** seed rows for drafting and shelf order, **not** operator-authored corpora. **Enumerated list (SSOT):** [`docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/bookshelf-catalog.yaml`](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/bookshelf-catalog.yaml) · runbook [`BOOKSHELF-RUNBOOK.md`](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/BOOKSHELF-RUNBOOK.md). **Do not** tag these with **`shelf_intent: operator_book`** or **`scope: operator_analytical`**; use **[LIB-0158](#bookshelf)**.

| ID | Title | SSOT |
|----|--------|------|
| **LIB-0158** | Bookshelf (**self-library-bookshelf** — owned print catalog) | [BOOKSHELF.md](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/BOOKSHELF.md) · [`bookshelf-catalog.yaml`](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/bookshelf-catalog.yaml) · [runbook](../../docs/skill-work/work-strategy/history-notebook/research/BOOKSHELF-RUNBOOK.md) |

**Contrast:** [LIB-0156](#operator-analytical-books) is the **History Notebook** project (your compressed **chapters**). [LIB-0158](#bookshelf) is the **owned print** set on the **bookshelf** that **informs** those chapters.

## Theology

**Purpose:** A named shelf for sources that bear on **belief, practice, sacred narrative, ethics-as-tradition, or comparative religion** — and for material **derived from** that tradition (e.g. seam, see-the-face, coordination, AI ethics). Keeps theology-related return-to material in one place without mixing into geography/science/history by default.

**How it works (schema-aligned):**
- Entries use the normal **lanes** (`reference`, `canon`, `influence`) and **types** from [library-schema.md](../../docs/library-schema.md).
- Mark theological (or theology-derived) material by adding **`theology`** to **`scope`**; add narrower tags if useful (e.g. `Christianity`, `Islam`, `coordination`, `see_the_face`, `ethics`).
- Nothing here bypasses the **gated pipeline**: facts or claims about the companion’s beliefs belong in SELF via RECURSION-GATE; LIBRARY only holds **approved return-to sources** (books, articles, essays, notes, etc.).

**Current entries (Theology shelf):**

| ID | Title | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| **LIB-0140** | Exercise: See the Face (school children) | Classroom exercise: find the face inside the category; children |
| **LIB-0141** | AI Ethics from the Condition | Ethics rules for AI derived from the Condition: seam visibility, condition-first, harm diagnostic. |
| **LIB-0142** | Lens: God | Applies Scott Adams |
| **LIB-0143** | The Delusion of Separation | Recognition theory, the seam, delusion of separation, persistent frequency field, six alternative frequencies. |
| **LIB-0144** | God is non-zero sum | Concept: the divine / the good is non-zero-sum; recognition and coordination grow for all; aligns with Condition, face vs category, blade vs beauty, one subject many tongues. |
| **LIB-0145** | Expand the light of consciousness (Musk) | Musk: duty to maintain/extend/preserve the light of consciousness; expand into the universe. In civ-mem: expand vs blade; aligns with Condition, be fruitful and multiply, non-zero-sum. |
| **LIB-0146** | Polyphonic cognition | Concept: multiple perspectives/voices held at once, tensions preserved, no single resolution. Links to Bakhtin (polyphony), Moscovici (cognitive polyphasia); STATE and one subject many tongues. |
| **LIB-0147** | Universal Love and Mastery | Essay: only through universal love can we master the universe. Universal love = face not category; mastery = capacity to extend, not domination. Attention as most valuable resource (steward toward recognition); purpose = create memories; monad probes and discovers itself through them. One subject many tongues, seam, Babel. |
| **LIB-0148** | Writing the Book and Death | Essay: the most interesting activity is writing the book; we need not fear death or seek eternal life; the good is in the doing. Making-with, LLM-using; purpose = memory; put down the blade so more of that activity can happen. |

**Paths:** All live under `docs/civilization-memory/` — essays in `essays/`, notes in `notes/`. Index: [essays/README.md](../../docs/civilization-memory/essays/README.md).

## Physics, chemistry & biology

**Purpose:** One shelf for **physical and life sciences** — motion, matter, energy, reactions, living systems, genetics, and lab framing — so lookup does not split STEM by department unless you add finer tags.

**How it works (schema-aligned):**
- Entries keep normal **lanes** and **types** ([library-schema.md](../../docs/library-schema.md)).
- Tag **`scope`** with one or more of:
  - **`physics`** — forces, motion, energy, space, astronomy, flight  
  - **`chemistry`** — atoms, reactions, materials, mixtures  
  - **`biology`** — life, cells, body systems, ecology, DNA/genes  
- **`science`** still means mixed or general STEM.

**Current entries (examples):**

| ID | Title | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| **LIB-0003** | Usborne Science Encyclopedia: An In-depth Guide for Young Scientists Exploring Gravity, Flight, Genes, DNA and More, with Over 180 Video Clips and 1000 Recommended Websites for Further Learning | Ordered Sept 2025. |

---

## History

**Purpose:** A named shelf for **chronology, civilizations, primary/secondary historical sources, and world-regional narrative** — without duplicating pure mythology-as-story unless the entry is history-forward (timelines, empires, documents).

**How it works (schema-aligned):**
- Entries keep normal **lanes** and **types**.
- Add **`history`** or **`world history`** (and tags like `ancient`, `Rome`, `China`, `civilizations`) to **`scope`**.
- Myth-heavy canon can still touch history; prefer this shelf when the **return-to reason** is historical context, not myth retell alone.

**Current entries (examples):**

| ID | Title | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| **LIB-0002** | Usborne World History Encyclopedia: An Illustrated Introduction to World History for Kids, full of Maps, Time Charts and over 800 Links for Homework Help | Usborne Encyclopedias. Ordered Sept 2025. |
| **LIB-0132** | Civilization Memory Codex | Grace-Mar satellite: docs/civilization-memory/ (essays, hybrid corpus) — not upstream MEM/STATE. See docs/civilization-memory/README.md. |
| **LIB-0157** | Civilization Memory (upstream repository) | Full CMC: MEM, STATE, SCHOLAR, ARC, templates. Local research/repos/civilization_memory/; LIB entry + SELF-LIBRARY symlink; tri-frame routing doc in work-strategy/minds/. |

---

## Computer Science

**Purpose:** A named shelf for **programming, software, algorithms, systems, and computing** — so lookup can filter by CS topics without mixing into pure math or general STEM unless you add finer tags. Includes AI/ML when the return-to reason is technical or educational (e.g. how models work, coding with AI); ethics-of-AI can also sit here or in Theology depending on scope.

**How it works (schema-aligned):**
- Entries keep normal **lanes** and **types** ([library-schema.md](../../docs/library-schema.md)).
- Add **`computer_science`** (or **`programming`**, **`software`**, **`algorithms`**, **`AI`**, **`systems`**) to **`scope`** so lookup and human scan can filter.
- Nothing here bypasses the **gated pipeline**: LIBRARY holds approved return-to sources only.

**Current entries:**

**Current entries:**

| ID | Title | Description |
|----|--------|-------------|
| **LIB-0150** | Arbitrage Rotation Framework — Rolling Disruption and Upstream Value Migration | Five gap types (speed, reasoning, fragmentation, discipline, intelligence arbitrage). Three dynamics: rapid compression on model-release timescale, permanent rolling disruption (no steady state), upstream value migration toward judgment/taste/systems-thinking. Core insight: inefficiency is market structure, not a bug — AI compresses it faster than any prior technology. Source: Polymarket bot analysis (2025-2026). |
