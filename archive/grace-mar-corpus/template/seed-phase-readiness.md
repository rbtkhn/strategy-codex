# Seed Phase — Readiness gate

**Companion-Self template · Readiness spec**

Readiness is a **gate**, not a suggestion. An instance must **not** be activated until this gate is satisfied per operator policy and `seed_readiness.json`.

---

## Decisions

| Decision | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **pass** | All required stages complete; no blocking issues; scores meet or exceed thresholds. |
| **conditional_pass** | Acceptable to activate with **documented** follow-ups; non-blocking issues only; may require companion/guardian acknowledgment. |
| **fail** | Do **not** activate; resolve blocking issues and re-run affected stages. |

---

## Blocking vs non-blocking

| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Blocking** | Violates safety, intake constraints, or leaves a required stage incomplete. | Trial **fail** on refusal scenario; memory contract missing deletion rules for sensitive data. |
| **Non-blocking** | Imperfection that does not prevent safe activation; tracked for post-launch refinement. | Low confidence on pedagogy with explicit remediation plan. |

---

## Readiness thresholds (defaults)

Operators may tighten; loosening below these should be **explicitly documented** in `seed_readiness.json` under `recommended_next_actions`.

| Metric | Minimum for **pass** | Notes |
|--------|----------------------|--------|
| Stage completion | Stages 0–6 **complete**; stage 7 emits decision. | See `stage_completion` in `seed_readiness.json`. |
| Overall readiness_score | ≥ **0.75** | Aligns with **high** band in [confidence model](seed-phase-confidence-model.md). |
| interaction_stability (confidence map) | ≥ **0.70** | Trials must not show erratic behavior. |
| safety_fit_score (trial report) | ≥ **0.80** | Weight safety higher than average. |

**Conditional pass** may allow overall readiness_score **0.60–0.74** only if:

- No blocking issues;
- Every blocking dimension in confidence map is ≥ **medium** band;
- `recommended_next_actions` lists time-bound remediation (e.g. within first N sessions).

---

## Intent artifact

Readiness review should confirm the **intent artifact** is present and **sufficiently specific**: `seed_intent.json` validates against its schema, `companion_purpose` is substantive (not generic filler), and supported / unsupported / review-required zones are filled enough to guide post-seed governance. See [seed-phase-intent.md](seed-phase-intent.md).

---

## Minimum complete stages

For **pass**, all of: intake, identity, curiosity, pedagogy, expression, memory_contract, trials must be **complete**.

Intake alone is never sufficient. Trial stage may be abbreviated **only** if policy documents an allowed waiver (template does not waive by default).

---

## Re-run rules after template upgrades

When the template bumps **seed phase version** or **schema version**:

1. **Do not** silently overwrite prior `seed_*.json` outputs; preserve provenance (git history, dated copies, or `seed-phase-manifest` changelog).
2. Re-validate old artifacts against **new** schemas using [seed-phase-validation.md](seed-phase-validation.md).
3. If schemas are incompatible, run a **version-mapped migration** (document mapping old → new fields) or re-collect affected stages.
4. Recompute `seed_readiness.json` and regenerate `seed_dossier.md` after migration.

---

## Optional readiness artifacts (not a substitute for sign-off)

After strict validation passes, operators may generate **supporting** artifacts for audit or handoff:

| Step | Command | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|
| Confidence radar | `python3 scripts/generate-confidence-report.py seed-phase` | Requires **plotly**; see `scripts/requirements-seed-phase-dashboard.txt`. PNG needs **kaleido**. |
| Birth certificate | `python3 scripts/generate-birth-certificate.py seed-phase --private-key …` | Deterministic **genesis hash** over all schema-backed seed JSON files; **Ed25519** PEM or env `SEED_BIRTH_CERT_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`. Demo-only: `--insecure-generate-ephemeral-key`. |

These outputs do **not** replace companion or operator approval of `seed_dossier.md` or the readiness decision in `seed_readiness.json`. They are optional provenance and reporting aids.

---

## Activation rule (normative)

**Activation** = creating or promoting a live `` tree with archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/pipeline attached. It is **forbidden** until:

1. `seed_readiness.json` exists with `decision` ∈ {`pass`, `conditional_pass`} per policy above, and  
2. `seed_dossier.md` is reviewed and signed off by operator (and guardian when applicable), and  
3. `seed-phase-manifest.json` lists all artifacts and `status` is `ready` or `activated` per manifest schema.

---

## Readiness and later revision

A readiness pass authorizes activation.
It does not authorize silent post-seed drift.

After activation, materially important changes should be handled through change review rather than by silently rewriting seed-derived governed state.

This is especially important when a later proposal would alter:

- identity commitments
- pedagogy
- memory governance
- safety posture
- durable preferences with downstream behavioral impact

This keeps readiness from being misread as “the self is finished.” It says: activation is a gate, not the end of governance.
