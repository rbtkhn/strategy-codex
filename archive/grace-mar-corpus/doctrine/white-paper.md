# Grace-Mar White Paper

**Identity Fork Protocol (IFP) — Reference Implementation**

*A sovereign, evidence-linked, agent-consumable identity layer for the agent web*

*Version 1.0 · February 2026*

---

## Abstract

The web is forking. A human web (visual, browse, product pages) and an agent web (structured data, APIs, markdown, tokenized payments) run in parallel. Agents are becoming economic actors: they search, pay, execute, and chain capabilities across services. Every major infrastructure company is building for agent-native clients.

The missing primitive: **identity and trust.** Agents need to know who they serve. They need identity data that is curated, evidence-grounded, and user-controlled — not scraped, hallucinated, or LLM-leaked.

Grace-Mar provides that substrate. This white paper describes the problem, the solution, and Grace-Mar's positioning as (1) supplemental to AI schools like AI school and (2) a low-cost open-source alternative for families outside elite tuition.

**Execution focus:** In the next 18 months, Grace-Mar prioritizes one wedge — hosted family product for homeschool/microschool adoption — while running a small number of integration pilots. Broader protocol commercialization (including certification) is intentionally sequenced after proof.

## 1. The Rise of AI Schools

### AI school and the 2-Hour Learning Model

mastery-learning school represents a new category: AI-powered K–12 microschools. Students learn 2–3 hours per day and achieve 99th-percentile outcomes. Tuition: $40,000–$75,000 per year depending on location.

**What AI school does well:**
- One-to-one mastery-based tutoring at scale via AI (Incept)
- Interest-aligned content — Avengers and soccer buddies woven into reading
- Zone of proximal development; 85% challenge sweet spot
- Motivation systems (motivation tokens, unlocks, team activities)
- Life skills: sailing, entrepreneurship, financial literacy

**Demand is proven.** Families pay premium tuition for personalized, interest-driven, mastery-based learning. Similar models (Astra Nova, Prisma, Synthesis) confirm the segment.

### What AI Schools Do Not Provide

| Dimension | AI school (and peers) | Gap |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| **Ownership** | Data lives in platform | Family has no portable asset |
| **Evidence** | Engagement metrics, placement scores | No artifacts — writing, art, "we did X" |
| **Personality** | Interest graph for content | Inferred, not user-approved |
| **Gate** | System auto-updates | No user approval step |
| **Portability** | Locked to platform | No export of identity or Record |
| **Access** | $40K–$75K/year | Most families excluded |

AI schools optimize for teaching outcomes. They do not provide a user-owned, evidence-grounded, portable Record of who the user is.

---

## 2. The Identity Gap

### The Trust Problem

Who owns the narrative of who the user is? Today:
- **Platforms** hold the data — engagement, placement, interests
- **Families** have no export, no artifact trail, no approval gate
- **Agents** (future tutors, admissions, employers) will need identity — and today there is no trusted source

Evidence in most systems = platform metrics. Personality = inferred from clicks. Knowledge = placement tests. None of this is user-curated or artifact-grounded.

### The Agent Web Fork

The human web and agent web serve different clients. Humans want product pages and search results. Agents want JSON, markdown, structured data. The mobile fork (2007) created trillion-dollar companies because the interface layer forked. The agent fork will do the same.

Infrastructure companies are building payment, search, content access, and execution for agents. The missing primitive: **trust in identity.** What builds trust?
- Evidence grounding — every claim traces to artifacts
- User control — nothing enters without approval
- Auditability — full history, provenance

Grace-Mar is designed for the agent interface: structured, machine-readable, queryable, and trust-grounded.

---

## 3. Grace-Mar: Supplemental and Alternative

### Dual Positioning

**Supplemental** — Grace-Mar works alongside AI school (and similar AI schools). AI school teaches; Grace-Mar records. The Record provides the identity, interest, and personality layer that Incept can consume for personalization. School events feed the pipeline as evidence. The Record is the user-owned substrate; AI school is one consumer. Integration, not competition.

**Low-cost alternative** — AI school tuition excludes most families. Grace-Mar is open-source. Families who cannot afford $40K–$75K/year can run Grace-Mar with Khan Academy, IXL, or any adaptive platform. Same identity architecture at $0 software cost. Democratizes the cognitive-fork model.

### Sequencing to Reduce Execution Risk

Grace-Mar treats the two positions asymmetrically:
- **Now (0-18 months):** family-hosted product as primary wedge.
- **Parallel but limited:** 1-2 scoped integration pilots with explicit success criteria.
- **Later:** platform-scale licensing and certification after demonstrated retention, trust metrics, and pilot outcomes.

### Ideal Stacks

| Stack | Cost | Grace-Mar Role |
|-------|------|----------------|
| AI school + Grace-Mar | $40K–$75K + hosted | Supplemental Record layer |
| Khan + Khanmigo + Grace-Mar | ~$48/year | Low-cost alternative |
| IXL + Grace-Mar | ~$127/year | Low-cost alternative |
| Open TutorAI + Grace-Mar | $0 | Fully free stack |

## 4. The Grace-Mar Model

### Cognitive Fork

A **cognitive fork** is a versioned, evidence-grounded record of an individual's cognitive development — initialized from a real person at a point in time, growing through curated interactions over a lifetime.

Like a software fork:
- **Seed** = initial snapshot (identity, personality, baselines)
- **Interact** = each session is a commit
- **Diverge** = fork and real person grow independently — by design
- **Merge** = user brings new data when they choose
- **Snapshot** = git tags preserve state (e.g., grace-mar-age-6)

The fork is not a real-time mirror. It is a living, growing Record.

### Core Structure

| Module | Contains | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **SELF** | Personality, linguistic style, life narrative, preferences, values, reasoning patterns | Who they ARE |
| **SKILLS** | THINK and WRITE capability containers | What the Record can evidence about what they CAN DO |
| **WORK LAYER** | `work-*` territories and instance work contexts | Planning, execution, delivery, and tool-using work adjacent to the Record |

### Three-Dimension Mind (Post-Seed Growth)

| Dimension | Section | What it captures |
|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Knowledge** | IX-A | Facts entering awareness through observation |
| **Curiosity** | IX-B | Topics that catch attention, engagement signals |
| **Personality** | IX-C | Observed behavioral patterns, art style, speech traits |

A single artifact can populate all three dimensions. Entries link to evidence (ACT-XXXX).

### Gated Pipeline

All profile changes pass through a user-controlled gate:

1. **Signal detection** — LLM analyst identifies knowledge, curiosity, personality from input
2. **Candidate staging** — Proposals written to recursion-gate.md
3. **User review** — Approve, reject, or modify
4. **Integration** — Approved changes merge to SELF, EVIDENCE, prompt, SESSION-LOG

**Critical:** The agent may stage. It may not merge. The user is the gate.

### Evidence Grounding

Every claim traces to artifacts:
- WRITE-0001, CREATE-0003, ACT-0042 — activity IDs
- IX entries include `evidence_id` and `provenance: human_approved`
- No undocumented knowledge; no LLM inference into the Record
- Calibrated abstention: when outside knowledge, say "I don't know" and offer to look up

---

## 5. Differentiation: Grace-Mar vs. AI school

| Dimension | mastery-learning school | Grace-Mar |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **Primary function** | Teach (AI tutor, adaptive apps, mastery) | Record (identity, evidence, archive) |
| **Data ownership** | School/platform | User/family |
| **Evidence source** | Platform metrics, engagement | Artifacts, "we did X," cross-context |
| **Personality dimension** | Interest graph for content | IX-C: structured, evidence-linked, user-approved |
| **Gate** | None — system auto-updates | User approves every merge |
| **Knowledge boundary** | Incept generates; may infer | Only user-provided; no LLM leak |
| **Portability** | Locked to AI school platform | Export, open schema, agent-consumable |
| **Cost** | $40K–$75K/year | Open-source; self-host or low-cost hosted |
| **Lifetime scope** | School years | Lifetime; cross-context; legacy shareable |

**Narrative:** AI school proves demand for AI-powered, mastery-based, interest-aligned learning. Grace-Mar addresses what AI school does not: user-owned identity, evidence grounding, portability, and access.

---

## 6. Trust Primitive

### User Gate = Sovereignty (The Sovereign Merge Rule)

*The agent may stage. It may not merge.* The user controls what enters the Record. This is architectural, not configurable. Serious security assumes the agent may be an adversary; the Sovereign Merge Rule enforces that assumption.

### Evidence Linkage = Auditability

Every IX entry traces to ACT-XXXX. Pipeline events (staged, applied, rejected) are logged. Git history is the audit trail. No silent edits; no undocumented additions.

### Knowledge Boundary = No LLM Leak

The emulated self (Voice) can only reference what is in the profile. When outside knowledge, it abstains and offers to look up. LLM training data never leaks into the Record. This is a safety feature, not a limitation.

### Export = Agent-Consumable Identity

The Record exports to OpenClaw `user.md` / `SOUL.md` (identity filenames) and future school platform-compatible formats — the companion **self** in agent-consumable form. Structured markdown, schema, manifest. Designed for consumption by software — tutors, platforms, agents.

---

## 7. Integration and Ecosystem

### Record as Identity Source

- **school platform** — Record feeds personalization; school events stage to pipeline
- **OpenClaw** — Record populates user.md; session continuity spans both systems
- **Personal agents** — Any agent needing identity can consume the export

### Staging Contract

Agents may stage candidates to RECURSION-GATE. They may not merge. The format is open; the boundary is enforced. Schools, bots, and third-party tools can contribute; the user decides what enters.

### Future: Agent Manifest

An llms.txt-style manifest: what's readable, writable, schema. Discoverability for agent ecosystems.

---

## 8. Commercialization Model

### Initial Customer Profile

- Parent/guardian-led homeschool and microschool families
- Multi-tool learning stack users (Khan/IXL/tutors) with continuity gaps
- High sensitivity to ownership, portability, and evidence traceability

### Distribution Model (First 12 Months)

| Channel | Why it fits | Leading indicator |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Homeschool communities | High pain and high trust in peer references | Waitlist-to-activation conversion |
| Educator creators/newsletters | Efficient education-led demand creation | Cost per activated family |
| Parent referrals | Record value compounds over time | Referral share of new activations |

### Pilot Integration Package (90 Days)

| Component | Definition |
|-----------|------------|
| Scope | Identity read + stage path only; merge remains human-only |
| Stakeholders | Product lead + learning-science lead + operator |
| Success metrics | activation lift, personalization quality signal, operator burden delta |
| Deliverables | Pilot report, security notes, rollout recommendation |

---
## 9. Governance and Security

### Principles-Based Guidance

Grace-Mar encodes principles: "Never leak LLM knowledge," "Meet the user where they are," "The user is the gate," "Calibrated abstention." These scale across novel situations. Rigid rules would not.

### Agent as Potential Adversary

The agent may build and maintain tooling (scripts, docs, staging automation). The agent may never merge into the Record. Document this as security posture, not just pipeline design.

### 70/30: Human Sovereignty

Infrastructure is built for fully autonomous agents. Many users want ~70% human control. Grace-Mar is firmly in the 70% camp. As agent autonomy grows, a human-curated identity substrate becomes more valuable — a hedge against unconstrained automation.

---

## 10. Motivation and Engagement

### The Homeschool Gap

An AI school's homeschool pilot: same platform, 1x results vs. 2.6x at full AI school. Motivation (incentives, culture, guides) is the bottleneck, not content.

Grace-Mar does not build incentive systems (bucks, store). We stay in the Record lane. But the Record **feeds** motivation: interests, curiosity, personality. The Record is the **engagement substrate** — the structured input that tutors, platforms, and operators use to reach and motivate.

### "We Did X" as Ritual

The "we did X" convention is a lightweight motivation primitive: recognition, celebration, accountability. When the user reports "we read X" or "we drew Y," the system stages candidates. The user approves. The Record grows. Evidence-grounding = confidence-grounding: artifacts → "you did this" → grounded self-view.

---

## 11. Proof Architecture

Grace-Mar claims should be evaluated as an operating system, not only as a concept. The minimum proof set:

| Proof Track | Metric | Cadence |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Pipeline health | staged/approved/rejected/applied rates and queue age | Weekly |
| Gate integrity | merge receipt coverage and merge audit completeness | Weekly |
| Retention | week-4 and month-3 cohort retention | Monthly |
| Evidence quality | artifact-linked claim ratio over time | Monthly |
| Knowledge boundary safety | counterfactual harness pass rate | Per release |

### Unit Economics as Hypothesis (Not Conclusion)

Current business assumptions (CAC, churn, conversion, ARPU) are planning inputs and must be reported as observed vs. assumed each quarter.

---

## 12. Conclusion

Grace-Mar is identity infrastructure for the agent web. It provides:

1. **User-owned Record** — Portable, evidence-grounded, agent-consumable
2. **Trust primitive** — Gate, evidence linkage, knowledge boundary
3. **Supplemental path** — Add Record layer to AI school and similar schools
4. **Low-cost path** — Open-source alternative for families outside elite tuition

The agent web needs to know who it serves. Grace-Mar is the substrate.
