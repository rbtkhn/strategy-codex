## Summary

<!-- What does this PR change and why? -->

## Lane declaration (required for CI)

**Add a GitHub label** on this PR so lane-scope checks pass:

| Your change | Label to add |
|------------|----------------|
| work-dev integration (OpenClaw, handback, work-dev docs/scripts) | `lane/work-dev` |
| work-jiang research lane | `lane/work-jiang` |
| companion Record / users / bot prompt | `lane/companion-record` |
| work-politics scripts/docs | `lane/work-politics` |
| work-strategy docs / daily-brief config / strategy modules | `lane/work-strategy` |
| work-cici advisor / project docs (mirrors, runbooks) | `lane/work-cici` |
| repo infra (workflows, pyproject, broad tooling) | `lane/infra` |

Use **exactly one** primary lane label above.

If the diff **intentionally crosses lanes**, also add **`lane/cross`** and fill the justification block below (non-empty fenced block required).

## Lane declaration (human-readable)

- [ ] This PR is **work-dev** only — label `lane/work-dev`
- [ ] This PR is **work-jiang** only — label `lane/work-jiang`
- [ ] This PR is **companion-record** / **work-politics** / **work-strategy** / **work-cici** / **infra** only — matching `lane/...`
- [ ] This PR **intentionally crosses lanes** — labels `lane/cross` + one primary `lane/...` + justification below

### Cross-lane justification

<!-- Required when `lane/cross` is set: non-empty body or CI fails. -->

## Checklist

- [ ] Tests / validation run locally where relevant
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior or operator workflow changed

## Complexity impact (repo-health)

Local preflight: `python3 scripts/check_repo_health.py --quick` (required-style) or `--full` (includes advisory checks).

CI: [`.github/workflows/repo-health.yml`](.github/workflows/repo-health.yml) — **Required** job must pass; **Advisory** job is warn-mode until Phase 9 promotion ([`docs/complexity-budget.md`](docs/complexity-budget.md)).

- [ ] **No complexity impact** — typo, localized fix, or docs outside primary routing/agent surfaces
- [ ] **Generated surfaces** — ran relevant generator `--check` (see [`generated-manifest.yaml`](generated-manifest.yaml))
- [ ] **Routing / repo-map** — `validate_repo_routing.py --strict` and `generate_llm_routing.py --check`
- [ ] **New root file** — added to [`root-file-budget.yaml`](root-file-budget.yaml) with category + relocation note if applicable
- [ ] **Grace-Mar / fork mentions** — primary-path docs use short pointers only ([`docs/archive/grace-mar.md`](docs/archive/grace-mar.md))
- [ ] **Root count / budget** — acknowledged over-budget state (33/20) or reduced count toward target ≤ 20
