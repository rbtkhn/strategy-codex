# Swarm lane

This lane is the operator-facing swarm bridge for auto-research.

It does not create a second staging path. In this first slice, it reuses
accepted artifacts from `auto-research/self-proposals/accepted/` and promotes
them into the live gate only through the shared artifact-promotion helper.

## Contract

- keep experiments and read models under `auto-research/swarm/`
- do not append ad hoc content to `recursion-gate.md`
- do not emit custom gate-only events in place of `staged`
- keep promotion explicit and operator-mediated
- keep swarm state off the child Voice surface

## State

`swarm-state.json` is a read model written by `orchestrator.py`. It is safe to
regenerate. It summarizes:

- last refresh timestamp
- runner status
- recent accepted artifacts
- recent promotions
- pending artifact count

## Commands

Refresh and print status:

```bash
python3 auto-research/swarm/orchestrator.py status
```

Show the latest swarm-visible artifact:

```bash
python3 auto-research/swarm/orchestrator.py last
```

Run an advisory debate review for the latest swarm-visible artifact:

```bash
python3 auto-research/swarm/orchestrator.py debate latest
```

Print the full derived debate artifact:

```bash
python3 auto-research/swarm/orchestrator.py debate latest --json
```

Promote an artifact with operator review note:

```bash
python3 auto-research/swarm/orchestrator.py promote latest --review-note "Operator reviewed grounding and wants gate visibility."
```

## First-slice scope

This slice intentionally excludes daemon lifecycle management. No `start` or
`stop` command is provided here or in Telegram. Background supervision belongs
outside the bot process.

It also keeps debate advisory only. Debate may write derived review artifacts,
but it may not stage candidates or bypass the shared promotion helper.
