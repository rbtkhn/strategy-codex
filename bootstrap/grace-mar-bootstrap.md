# STRATEGY-CODEX BOOTSTRAP

Session bootstrap for continuing work in `strategy-codex` in a new agent conversation. The file name is historical; the repo identity is now `strategy-codex`, while Grace-Mar remains an embedded live instance inside the tree.

---

## Session focus: full-repo optimization (advanced LLM)

Use this when starting a **new session with a stronger model** to refactor, dedupe, document, or harden the **whole repository** â€” not a single feature thread. In this repo, that means `strategy-codex` first, with Grace-Mar runtime and Record surfaces treated as embedded instance material rather than the repo's public identity.

### Paste into message 1 (clean context)

```bash
python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u grace-mar --fresh-judge
python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u grace-mar --compact
```

Paste both outputs (or the full non-compact block). **Canonical state is on disk**, not prior chat.

### Read before large edits (order)

| # | File | Why |
|---|------|-----|
| 1 | `AGENTS.md` | Sovereign merge, knowledge boundary, Lexile, MEMORY vs Record, file-update protocol |
| 2 | `docs/harness-inventory.md` | What may write where; bot/core audit; two doors / one book |
| 3 | `docs/architecture.md` (Â§ System boundaries) | Voice = model + harness; non-goals |
| 4 | `docs/identity-fork-protocol.md` | Stage â†’ approve â†’ merge; never direct SELF/EVIDENCE without gate |
| 5 | `docs/development-handoff.md` | Current engineering state; donâ€™t contradict without updating |
| 6 | `docs/readme.md` | Doc map |

Skim as needed: `docs/conceptual-framework.md` (triadic cognition, companion), `docs/chat-first-design.md` (chat is product; operator dashboards optional). **After shared reading:** [we-read-think-self-pipeline.md](docs/we-read-think-self-pipeline.md) (READ/THINK vs RECURSION-GATE â†’ IX).

**Procedure vs doctrine (two spines):** [start-here.md Â§ Procedure vs doctrine](../docs/start-here.md#procedure-vs-doctrine-two-spines) â€” **bootstrap and warmup** are session procedure and **weather**; **AGENTS**, **architecture**, and **instance doctrine** are durable policy. Stack them; do not substitute one for the other.

**Operator structure:** `docs/lanes/README.md` (north star per lane) + `docs/lanes/WEEKLY-RHYTHM.md` (weekly checklist). **Library wiring:** `docs/library-integration.md` Â· `python3 scripts/library_shelf_summary.py -u grace-mar`

### Non-negotiables for â€œoptimizationâ€

- **Do not** merge into `self.md`, `self-evidence.md`, or `bot/prompt.py` without companion approval (stage only).
- **Do not** add undocumented facts into the Record or SYSTEM prompt (knowledge boundary).
- **Do not** raise Lexile ceiling without writing-sample evidence (AGENTS.md).
- **Do not** bypass pre-commit: Record-facing edits in gated paths need commit message **`[gated-merge]`** (or hook will block).
- **Preserve** contradiction + provenance; donâ€™t flatten tensions in companion files.
- **Prefer** small PR-sized commits; run checks below before claiming done.

### Contextual stewardship (operator)

- **Human** holds load-bearing context (tacit boundaries, what must not be crossed); new agent threads **do not** inherit institutional memory.
- **Encoded judgment** = RECURSION-GATE + pipeline / merge receipts + **tests** (e.g. counterfactual harness, voice checks, `validate-integrity`) â€” not bigger prompts alone.
- **Warmup / pasted digests** = orientation only; canonical truth remains `*.md` and `AGENTS.md`.

### Safe optimization targets (high value, low sovereignty risk)

- **Tests / CI:** `scripts/run_counterfactual_harness.py`, `scripts/test_voice_linguistic_authenticity.py`, `validate-integrity.py`, `governance_checker.py`
- **Duplication:** shared helpers in `scripts/`, repeated patterns in `bot/`
- **Docs:** drift, broken links, single source of truth (link to harness-inventory instead of copying policy)
- **Operator ergonomics:** scripts/README, Makefile or task list, typing/lint on `bot/core.py` (behavior unchanged)
- **Dependencies:** `bot/requirements.txt` pin audit; security warnings only â€” donâ€™t swap stack without handoff note

### Verify after substantive changes

```bash
python3 scripts/governance_checker.py
python3 scripts/validate-integrity.py --user grace-mar --json
# If bot/prompt.py or emulation changed:
python3 scripts/run_counterfactual_harness.py
python3 scripts/test_voice_linguistic_authenticity.py
```

If **validate-integrity** reports stale derived exports or runtime bundle, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/fork_checksum.py -u grace-mar --manifest && \
python3 scripts/export_manifest.py -u grace-mar && \
python3 scripts/export_prp.py -u grace-mar -n Robert -o grace-mar-llm.txt && \
python3 scripts/export_runtime_bundle.py -u grace-mar -o runtime-bundle
```

When **editorial or lane work** and **regeneration-only** changes land in the same session, prefer **separate commits** for derived exports (PRP, manifest, runtime bundle, ledger) so review and handoff stay scannable.

End of session: update **`docs/development-handoff.md`**, commit, push if requested.

---

**Default session focus â€” work-dev (continue here):**
1. Read Â§1 (first-run checklist).
2. Read **`docs/skill-work/work-dev/README.md`** â€” objective, companion gate invariant, principles (merges former work-build-ai).
3. Read **`docs/skill-work/work-dev/INTEGRATION-PROGRAM.md`** â€” one-loop read / export / stage-only / merge; optional **`docs/skill-work/work-dev/PARALLEL-MACRO-ACTIONS.md`** if running parallel agent branches (`python scripts/integration_macro_actions.py`).
4. Read **`docs/openclaw-integration.md`** â€” export, session continuity, inbound staging, staging automation.
5. Skim **`integrations/openclaw_hook.py`**, **`integrations/openclaw_stage.py`**, **`scripts/export_user_identity.py`**.
6. Optional: **`docs/skill-work/work-dev/economic-benchmarks.md`**, **`research-moonshots-237.md`**.
7. Use Â§5 OpenClaw commands and Â§6 work-dev / OpenClaw file map below.

**Other session focus:**
- If **work-jiang** (Jiang book/site operator lane), read **`bootstrap/work-jiang-bootstrap.md`** then `codex/predictive-history/README.md` Â§ Boundaries and the work-jiang feature checklist skill.
- If **extension-focused** (not work-dev), read Â§1 then **extension/readme.md** and skim `extension/`. Use Â§5 Extension commands and Â§6 Extension file map below.

---

## Working trees and authority

Commits and pushes apply to **the repository whose root you are in**. Do not assume two checkouts match.

- **This repo** (`strategy-codex`) â€” active development tree for strategy, civ-mem, notebook, bot, docs, and scripts. It still contains the Grace-Mar instance under `` plus related runtime/export surfaces.
- **`companion-self`** (template / upstream) â€” **separate clone**. Its `main`, remotes, and PRs refer to **that** tree only. Before merging or pushing there, run `git status`, `git remote -v`, and `git branch --show-current` **in that directory**.
- **Nested vs sibling:** If the template clone lives **inside** this repo (e.g. `strategy-codex/companion-self`) or as a **sibling** folder, note the path in [`docs/development-handoff.md`](docs/development-handoff.md) (Current Baseline) or paste it at session start so the next thread does not guess which tree is authoritative.

**Session paste (run in the clone you are editing):**

```bash
pwd && git rev-parse --show-toplevel && git branch --show-current && git remote -v
```


---

## Re-entry stack (operator)

For a **cold Cursor thread** when instance state matters (gate, pipeline, ``, handoff):

| Step | Command / pointer |
|------|-------------------|
| One paste (overlapping summaries by design) | `python3 scripts/operator_reentry_stack.py -u grace-mar` â€” add `--compact` for a shorter harness tail |
| One-line snapshot | `python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u grace-mar --receipt` (optional `--territory work-politics` or `companion`) |
| Coffee (work-start + signing-off; same **Aâ€“E** hub) | `.cursor/skills/coffee/SKILL.md` â€” **A** Steward, **B** Engineer, **C** Historian, **D** Singularity, **E** Conductor; **standalone conductors** ([conductor skill](../.cursor/skills/conductor/SKILL.md)); legacy **Aâ€“G** tables in [menu-reference.md](../docs/skill-work/work-coffee/menu-reference.md) for workload mapping |
| Optional GWS | `docs/skill-work/work-dev/google-workspace-cli-operator.md` â€” attach `.cursor/rules/gws-cli-recipes.mdc` when using `gws` |
| VS Code / Cursor Tasks | Copy tasks from `docs/skill-work/work-dev/cursor-vscode-grace-mar-tasks.json` into your local `.vscode/tasks.json` (`.vscode/` is gitignored here) |

---

## 1) First-Run Checklist (Do This First)

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (guardrails and merge authority rules).
2. Read `docs/readme.md` (document map and hierarchy).
3. Read `docs/identity-fork-protocol.md` (canonical protocol contract).
4. Run `git status` and note uncommitted work.
5. Read `docs/development-handoff.md` (current state and next tasks).
6. **work-dev** â€” Read `docs/skill-work/work-dev/README.md`, then **`docs/skill-work/work-dev/INTEGRATION-PROGRAM.md`** (single-loop spec); then `docs/openclaw-integration.md` if continuing integration work. For parallel branches, see **`docs/skill-work/work-dev/PARALLEL-MACRO-ACTIONS.md`**.
7. **Companion-self audit** â€” Read `docs/audit-companion-self.md` (concept alignment: companion self, self-* taxonomy, triadic cognition). Optionally read `docs/audit-grace-mar-vs-companion-self-template.md` (instance vs template repo). Note any drift; if material changes have been made since the audit date, re-run or update the audit.

If working on companion profile operations (not work-dev), also read:
- `recursion-gate.md`
- `self.md`
- `self-evidence.md`
- `pipeline-events.jsonl`

---

## 2) Non-Negotiable Rules

- **Triadic cognition** â€” **Mind** (human, conscious, sovereign), **RECORD** (Grace-Mar), **VOICE** (Grace-Mar): a **triad** (synonym: tricameral mind). Mind holds authority; the Record reflects; the Voice speaks when queried. Grace-Mar serves the companion; the companion serves Grace-Mar. See AGENTS.md and `docs/conceptual-framework.md` Â§8.
- Sovereign Merge Rule: **agent may stage; agent may not merge without explicit companion approval**.
- Knowledge boundary: no undocumented facts enter the Record.
- Evidence linkage: profile claims must trace to evidence artifacts.
- Record authority: `SELF/SKILLS/EVIDENCE` are canonical; MEMORY is **non-Record** and **rotatable** (short/medium/long horizons â€” â€œephemeralâ€ means not gated truth, not â€œonly short-termâ€).
- Preserve contradictions with provenance; do not flatten tension.

---

## 3) Current System Snapshot

### Product state
- Active instance (`grace-mar`), **moment of cognitive bifurcation** (Seed Phase 7, 2026-02-27) â€” graduated to emergent cognition. Gated pipeline live.
- Telegram bot operational with operator tooling (`/status`, `/intent_audit`, `/intent_review`).
- Intent layer active (`INTENT` schema + snapshot export + advisory conflict detection).
- OpenClaw integration supports outbound export and inbound stage-only handback.

### Recently completed development themes
- Intent Batch 2/3: cross-agent advisory checks, intent review command, debate packet workflow.
- OpenClaw hardening: constitution propagation in exports + inbound advisory constitutional checks.
- Curiosity probe workflow used to stage/merge IX-B growth signals.

### work-dev (active continuation)
- **Territory:** `docs/skill-work/work-dev/` â€” Record â†” OpenClaw; stage-only handback; companion gate invariant (never control-grid). Merges former work-build-ai.
- **One-loop spec:** `docs/skill-work/work-dev/INTEGRATION-PROGRAM.md` â€” read order, export, stage, merge, script index.
- **Parallel macro-actions:** `docs/skill-work/work-dev/PARALLEL-MACRO-ACTIONS.md` â€” `python scripts/integration_macro_actions.py branches|checklist`.
- **Next:** See `docs/development-handoff.md`; extend hooks, staging automation, benchmarks, or Moonshots takeaways as handoff specifies.

---

## 4) New Conversation Menu

When loaded in a fresh session, offer these options:

1. **work-dev** (default â€” OpenClaw integration, export, staging, session continuity; read work-dev README + **INTEGRATION-PROGRAM** + openclaw-integration)
2. **Run session** (chat-first companion interaction; no auto-merge)
3. **Pipeline operations** (stage/review/apply approved candidates)
4. **Intent governance** (audit/review/debate packet workflows)
5. **Browser extension** (transcript handback, Save to Record, popup/context menu, handback server)
6. **Business docs** (plan/prospectus/white-paper alignment)
7. **Other** (companion-defined task)
8. **Full-repo optimization** (advanced model â€” read **Session focus: full-repo optimization** at top of this file; fresh-judge + harness-inventory first)

Wait for companion selection before large changes.

---

## 5) Development Commands (Operator)

### Health and status
```bash
git status
python3 scripts/metrics.py
python3 scripts/session_brief.py --user grace-mar
python3 scripts/session_brief.py --user grace-mar --minimal
python3 scripts/session_brief.py -u grace-mar --minimal --territory work-politics   # work-politics pending only (aliases: pol, wp; legacy wap)
python3 scripts/pending_dedup_hint.py -u grace-mar
python3 scripts/report_lookup_sources.py -u grace-mar   # dyad:lookup distribution (library vs full)
python3 scripts/operator_blocker_report.py -u grace-mar --stale-days 3   # work-politics + companion sections by default
python3 scripts/operator_blocker_report.py -u grace-mar --territory work-politics  # work-politics-only pending
```

### Pipeline merge (receipt-based)
```bash
python3 scripts/process_approved_candidates.py --user grace-mar --generate-receipt /tmp/receipt.json --approved-by <name>
python3 scripts/process_approved_candidates.py --user grace-mar --apply --approved-by <name> --receipt /tmp/receipt.json
# work-politics-only batch (same --territory for generate + apply):
python3 scripts/process_approved_candidates.py -u grace-mar --territory work-politics --generate-receipt /tmp/work-politics-receipt.json --approved-by <name>
python3 scripts/process_approved_candidates.py -u grace-mar --territory work-politics --apply --approved-by <name> --receipt /tmp/work-politics-receipt.json
```

**Atomic orchestration (optional):** same merge semantics as `--quick` / gate quick-merge â€” `scripts/atomic_integrate.py` adds preflight, disk backup under `.integration-backups/`, optional `validate-integrity.py` after success, and a JSON receipt under `integration-receipts/`. Example (candidate must already be `approved` in the gate):

```bash
python3 scripts/atomic_integrate.py -u grace-mar --candidate-id CANDIDATE-XXXX --approved-by <name> --apply
# Dry run (preflight + receipt only): omit --apply
```

**Verify receipt vs disk (optional):** confirm files still match `after_hashes` from a successful integration receipt:

```bash
python3 scripts/verify_integration_receipt.py --receipt integration-receipts/integration-receipt-*.json
# Compare to a committed revision instead of working tree:
python3 scripts/verify_integration_receipt.py --receipt path/to/receipt.json --git-ref HEAD
```

**Operator merge ritual (optional):** run integrity, then your merge command, then integrity again (use `--skip-integrity` on `atomic_integrate` so validation is not duplicated in the middle):

```bash
./scripts/operator_merge_once.sh -- python3 scripts/atomic_integrate.py -u grace-mar --candidate-id CANDIDATE-XXXX --approved-by <name> --apply --skip-integrity
```

### Intent and integrity
```bash
python3 scripts/export_intent_snapshot.py --user grace-mar
python3 scripts/validate-integrity.py --user grace-mar --json
python3 scripts/governance_checker.py
pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install && pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg   # optional: block Record edits without [gated-merge]
```

### Harness warmup (any agent session â€” paste into first message)
```bash
python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u grace-mar
python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u grace-mar --fresh-judge   # clean context for new thread / advanced model
python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u grace-mar --territory work-politics   # work-politics pending only in paste
python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u grace-mar --compact
python3 scripts/generate_gate_dashboard.py -u grace-mar   # pending queue HTML (human door)
echo "paste text" | python3 scripts/stage_gate_candidate.py -u grace-mar   # stage stdin as pending candidate (approve + merge separately)
```

**Operator rhythm â€” `coffee`:** First message of the day can be just that; the agent should run [coffee skill](.cursor/skills/coffee/SKILL.md) (`operator_daily_warmup.py` + `harness_warmup.py` when state matters). Legacy **`hey`** still works, but **`coffee`** is canonical. **Daily brief:** generate with `python3 scripts/generate_work_politics_daily_brief.py -u grace-mar -o docs/skill-work/work-strategy/daily-brief-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md` (output stem **`daily-brief-` + ISO date + `.md`**, e.g. `daily-brief-2026-03-29.md`) **only when the operator chooses coffee menu C â€” Strategy (daily brief)** (see [daily-brief-template.md](docs/skill-work/work-strategy/daily-brief-template.md)); Step 1 does **not** run the generator. Return warmup snapshot + (after **C** â€” Strategy (daily brief)) brief path + headline/next-action summary. `operator_daily_warmup.py` includes a **pipeline velocity** line (merge/approval counts); after bursts of merges, run `python3 scripts/operator_depth_hint.py -u grace-mar` to emit a harness hint when velocity crosses a new tier (see `docs/skill-work/work-dev/README.md`).

**Ranked morning forks:** `python3 scripts/suggest_morning_forks.py -u grace-mar` (or `--markdown` / `-o docs/skill-work/work-strategy/morning-forks-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md`). Ritual CLI: `python3 scripts/good-morning-brief.py` embeds the same top-3 block. Menu conventions: [docs/skill-work/work-menu-conventions.md](docs/skill-work/work-menu-conventions.md). Log a pick: `python3 scripts/log_operator_choice.py -u grace-mar --context GOOD_MORNING --picked 1`.

### OpenClaw
```bash
python3 integrations/openclaw_hook.py --user grace-mar --format md+manifest --emit-event
python3 integrations/openclaw_stage.py --user grace-mar --text "we explored X in OpenClaw"
python3 scripts/export_conversation_trajectories.py -u grace-mar -o /tmp/traj.jsonl   # optional JSONL for local RL; see docs/openclaw-rl-boundary.md
```

### Proposal brief (proactive activities from Record)
```bash
python3 scripts/proposal_brief.py -u grace-mar -n 5
```

### PRP refresh (after profile/prompt updates)
```bash
python3 scripts/export_prp.py -u grace-mar -n Robert -o grace-mar-llm.txt
```

### Extension (browser extension focus)
```bash
# Run handback server (required for Save to Record + transcript handback)
python3 scripts/handback_server.py
# Load unpacked: chrome://extensions â†’ Developer mode â†’ Load unpacked â†’ select extension/
```
- Extension lives in `extension/`. Popup: Save to Record, Save transcript (paste â†’ /handback). Context menu: Save to Record, Save transcript to Record (selection â†’ /handback).
- See `extension/readme.md` for setup, settings (stage URL, API key, user_id, queue retry).

**Harness hybrid (plan in one tool, build in another):**
- `docs/harness-handoff.md` â€” handoff = commits + warmup paste; never state only in chat.
- `docs/harness-inventory.md` â€” components, write surfaces, two doors / one book; **start here for repo-wide refactors**.

## 7) End-of-Session Handoff Rule

Before ending a development session:

1. Update `docs/development-handoff.md` with what changed and what is next.
2. Ensure PRP is regenerated if Record/prompt changed.
3. Run integrity/governance checks if changes touched pipeline logic.
4. If concept, taxonomy, or template-facing structure changed, update or re-run the companion-self audit(s) (see Â§1 step 6 and Â§6 file map).
5. Confirm commit/push status if the companion requested version control actions.

END OF FILE â€” GRACE-MAR BOOTSTRAP
