# Work-Dev Compound Dashboard

> **Boundary:** This dashboard is a derived **WORK** artifact. It does not update
> canonical **Record** surfaces, does not **approve** gate candidates, does not
> write to `recursion-gate.md`, and does not **promote** anything into durable memory.

## 1. Summary

- **Generated (UTC date):** 2026-04-25
- **Total compound notes:** 0
- **Gate-candidate notes (`gate_candidate` truthy):** 0

- **Duplicate title groups (normalized, 2+ files):** 0
- **Duplicate `reusable_pattern` groups (normalized, 2+ files):** 0

## 2. Compound notes inventory

There are **no** compound notes in the configured `compound-notes/` path, or the directory is missing. This is OK — add notes as you complete work.

## 3. Gate-candidate notes

> `gate_candidate: true` (or `yes`, etc.) means **review recommended**, not **approved**.

_(none)_

## 4. Stale review candidates

Notes older than **90** days with `gate_candidate` false. If the front matter `date` is missing, **file mtime** is used for the age check.

_(none)_

## 5. Duplicate hints (not modifications)

Review only; this dashboard does not edit note files.

### Normalized title duplicates

_(none detected)_

### Normalized `reusable_pattern` duplicates

_(none detected)_
