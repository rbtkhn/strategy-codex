# Agent Surfaces Table

Generated from `config/agent-surfaces.v1.json`.

This table is derived from the machine-readable Agent Sprawl Control Plane registry.
The JSON registry remains authoritative.
This table is not Record, not approval, not a merge path, and grants no authority.

- Implemented: 7
- Partial: 2
