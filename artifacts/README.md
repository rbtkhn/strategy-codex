# Repository artifacts (derived)

This tree holds **rebuildable, non-canonical** outputs from operator scripts. Nothing here is **Record truth**; recovery always points back to source files under ``, `docs/`, `skills-portable/`, etc.

**Operator surface taxonomy:** Generated and operator-facing paths are classified in [docs/operator-surface-registry.md](../docs/operator-surface-registry.md). New dashboard-like artifacts should be registered there (and satisfy the **dashboard anti-sprawl policy** there) before being treated as part of the stable operator interface.

**Staleness:** Artifacts are often **generated snapshots**. If a file has **no** generation time or **unclear** source declaration, treat freshness as **unknown** or **possibly stale** and **verify** against the governing source files (e.g. ``, gate file) before relying on it for load-bearing operator decisions. Convention and levels: [docs/operator-surface-staleness.md](../docs/operator-surface-staleness.md).

**Structured-file validation:** Parses committed JSON under `artifacts/` (skipping very large blobs), `schema-registry/`, and workflow examples; validates `pyproject.toml`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` when PyYAML is available; checks critical relative links in operator/workflow READMEs. Does not change doctrine.

```bash
python scripts/validate_structured_files.py
```

Primary doctrine stays **derived / rebuildable / non-canonical**. If you use `shadow layer` as an informal metaphor for these outputs, treat it as a glossary aid only, not a replacement term. It is **not** the same thing as `shadow-merges`, `shadow autonomy`, or any implied “shadow Record”.

**Important distinction:** the portable-record schema [`schema-registry/artifact-rationale.v1.json`](../schema-registry/artifact-rationale.v1.json) is about **demonstrated capability rationale** alongside EVIDENCE. It is **not** the schema for everything under `/artifacts/`.

Repo-owned derived regeneration may also emit per-artifact rebuild sidecars such as
`artifacts/library-index.md.derived-rationale.json`. Those sidecars follow
[`schema-registry/derived-artifact-rationale.v1.json`](../schema-registry/derived-artifact-rationale.v1.json)
and describe **how to rebuild a derived file**, not why an EVIDENCE artifact was good.

**Repo root `prepared-context/`** (not under `artifacts/`) may hold operator drafts and `last-budget-builds.json`; see [prepared-context/README.md](../prepared-context/README.md) and [context-budgeting.md](../docs/runtime/context-budgeting.md). **Policy mode defaults** (not Record): [`config/policy_modes/defaults.json`](../config/policy_modes/defaults.json), [docs/policy-modes.md](../docs/policy-modes.md).

## Commit-worthiness rule

Derived artifacts are not all equal. Before committing a changed file under `artifacts/`, classify it:

| Class | Commit posture |
|-------|----------------|
| Stable operator surface | Commit when the surface is part of the normal workflow, registered or listed here, and useful for review diffs. |
| Historical receipt or report | Commit only when the run itself is evidence for a feature, audit, demo, or partner-facing claim. |
| Rebuildable local snapshot | Prefer regeneration on demand; do not commit just because a script ran. |
| Scratch / cache / temp output | Keep gitignored or local unless explicitly promoted into a report. |

When in doubt, commit the source doctrine, script, test, or receipt that proves the behavior before committing a refreshed dashboard. A generated Markdown file should say which operator decision it supports and which source it does not replace.

**Companion-specific large blobs** (e.g. under `artifacts/`) follow separate rules in `.gitignore` and instance docs — not this folder.

## Regeneration contract

For the current repo-owned target set, use:

```bash
python3 scripts/regenerate_all_derived.py --changed --dry-run
python3 scripts/regenerate_all_derived.py --all
```

That flow writes three distinct non-canonical metadata families:

- **Rebuild receipts** under `artifacts/work-dev/rebuild-receipts/` — one receipt per regeneration run
- **Target manifest** at `artifacts/work-dev/derived-regeneration-manifest.json` — the declared target registry
- **Derived-artifact rationale sidecars** next to covered outputs — one sidecar per rebuilt artifact path

## Derived-artifact rationale sidecars

Sidecar naming is intentionally literal:

- `artifacts/library-index.md`
- `artifacts/library-index.md.derived-rationale.json`

The sidecar records rebuild provenance only:

- `producer_script`
- `policy_mode`
- `generated_at`
- `artifact_path`
- `canonical_surfaces_touched` (always `false`)
- `rebuild_command`
- `inputs`
- `rationale`
- `human_review_required`

Schema: [`schema-registry/derived-artifact-rationale.v1.json`](../schema-registry/derived-artifact-rationale.v1.json)

## Cleanup rule

Derived regeneration is **target-owned**, not whole-tree destructive:

- single-file outputs are overwritten by their producer scripts
- directory cleanup is allowed only for files explicitly owned by the selected rebuild target
- `.gitkeep` and unrelated artifact families must be preserved

This is why repo-owned regeneration stays narrower than “delete all of `/artifacts/` and hope.”
