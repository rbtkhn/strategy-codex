# Nate B. Jones â€” AI labor market (K-shape) and seven production skills (digest)

**Source:** YouTube, channel [AI News & Strategy Daily (Nate B Jones)](https://www.youtube.com/@NateBJones). Approximate title: *The AI Job Market Split in Two / $400K roles and hiring friction* (2026). **Transcript:** supplied by operator (Cursor session); cite exact URL when pinned.

**Scope:** External research for [work-dev](../../../../docs/skill-work/work-dev/README.md). Not Record truth until merged through the pipeline.

## Thesis (labor market)

- **K-shaped split:** Traditional knowledge-work openings (generalist PM, conventional SWE, standard analysts) **flat or falling**; roles that **design, build, operate, and manage AI/agentic systems** are **extremely tight** on qualified people.
- **Perception gap:** Employers report â€œcannot fillâ€; many applicants report â€œcannot get hiredâ€ â€” **mismatch**, some **exploitative hiring** (using candidates to learn AI), and candidates **overselling** or lacking production skills.
- **Speaker-cited stats (verify independently):** e.g. ~**3.2** open AI roles per qualified candidate; Manpower-style figures (~1.6M jobs vs ~0.5M qualified); **~142 days** time-to-fill. Treat as **directional** until sourced.

**Work-dev lens:** Buyer and operator vocabulary â€” **reliable governance of agentic systems** (not â€œchat skillsâ€) is the scarce capability; aligns with **silent failure**, **stage-only**, **companion gate**, and **portable Record**.

## Seven skills (from job postings, per speaker)

| # | Skill | One-line | Adjacent professions |
|---|--------|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Specification precision / clarity of intent** | Instructions literal enough that agents reproduce intent without drifting | Technical writing, law, QA |
| 2 | **Evaluation and quality judgment** | Automated evals, simulations, edge cases; resist fluent-wrong output; â€œtasteâ€ as repeatable error detection | Editing, auditing |
| 3 | **Task decomposition and multi-agent delegation** | Planner + sub-agents; **size work to the harness**; guardrails, not vague PM handoffs | PM (adapted) |
| 4 | **Failure pattern recognition** | Diagnose root causes and fix | SRE, risk, ops |
| 5 | **Trust and security design** | Human vs agent boundaries, blast radius, reversibility, frequency, **functional vs semantic** correctness | Risk, security |
| 6 | **Context architecture** | Persistent vs session context; clean retrieval; avoid polluting context; â€œlibrary for agentsâ€ | Librarians, tech writers |
| 7 | **Cost and token economics** | Blended model mix, ROI, $/MTok, planning before burning tokens | Applied math / finance |

## Six failure types (speaker)

1. **Context degradation** â€” quality drops as context window fills.
2. **Specification drift** â€” long runs lose original spec unless harness re-anchors.
3. **Sycophantic confirmation** â€” agent agrees with bad input and builds on it.
4. **Tool selection errors** â€” wrong tool, often from bad tool framing or overload.
5. **Cascading failure** â€” one agent error propagates without correction loops.
6. **Silent failure** â€” output **plausible** but **wrong in production** (hardest).

## Trust design dimensions (speaker)

- **Cost of error / blast radius**
- **Reversibility** (draft vs committed action)
- **Frequency** (volume of exposure)
- **Verifiability** â€” insist on **functional** correctness, not only plausible text
