# REPORT — PERSIA WAR CORPUS INTEGRATION

**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Mode:** LEARN (analysis) → WRITE (implementation)
**Scope:** 6 MEM–PERSIA–WAR–* files + CIV–INDEX–PERSIA + VERSION–MANIFEST
**Goal:** Integrate all Persia WAR MEMs into a coherent cross-referenced corpus
**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The LEARN session identified that MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER and MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ROME lacked MEM CONNECTIONS sections entirely, and that the six WAR MEMs were not fully cross-referenced as a sibling corpus. The session implemented full integration: MEM CONNECTIONS were added to the two anchor MEMs, all six WAR files received enriched cross-references with explicit "PERSIA WAR corpus" groupings, and CIV–INDEX–PERSIA was updated with a corpus arc note.

**Completion Status:**
- ✅ MEM CONNECTIONS added to WAR–ALEXANDER: 10+ connections (all WAR siblings, DARIUS–III, GEO, etc.)
- ✅ MEM CONNECTIONS added to WAR–ROME: 10+ connections (WAR siblings, EMPIRE figures, GEO)
- ✅ WAR corpus cross-refs enriched in MARATHON, THERMOPYLAE, SCYTHIAN, CARRHAE
- ✅ CIV–INDEX–PERSIA Section VIII: WAR corpus integration note
- ✅ VERSION–MANIFEST: entry for 2026-02-01

## II. SESSION CONTEXT

**User Request:** "switch to scholar learn mode ; integrate all persia WAR mems"

**Interpretation:** Cross-reference and connect all PERSIA WAR MEMs so they form a coherent integrated web, with MEM CONNECTIONS sections where missing and sibling-to-sibling links throughout.

**Corpus Identified:**
| MEM | Subject | Dates |
|-----|---------|-------|
| MEM–PERSIA–IONIAN–REVOLT | Satrapal rebellion; Athenian involvement | 499–493 BC |
| MEM–PERSIA–WAR–MARATHON | Persian expedition; encoding divergence | 490 BC |
| MEM–PERSIA–WAR–THERMOPYLAE | Xerxes; Greek stand; Persian tactical victory | 480 BC |
| MEM–PERSIA–WAR–SCYTHIAN | Darius's northern campaign; nomadic denial | c. 513–512 BC |
| MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER | Macedonian conquest; tempo over mass | 334–323 BC |
| MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE | Parthian denial victory; founding Roman–Persian | 53 BC |
| MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ROME | Seven-century parity war; endurance doctrine | c. 53 BC–628 AD |

## III. FILES MODIFIED

### A. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ALEXANDER (v1.3 → v1.4)

**Change:** Added Section X. MEM CONNECTIONS (previously absent).

**Connections added:**
- **PERSIA WAR corpus:** MARATHON, THERMOPYLAE, CARRHAE, SCYTHIAN, WAR–ROME
- **Other:** DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID–DARIUS–III, DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID, PERSEPOLIS, EGYPT, GEO–PERSIAN–GULF
- **Breaks if removed:** DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID–DARIUS–III, WAR–ROME

**Rationale:** Alexander MEM is the pivot between Greek wars (precedent) and Roman–Persian contest (terrain of ambition per Goldsworthy). SCYTHIAN contrast: tempo defeats Persia (Alexander) vs Scythians defeat Darius (nomadic denial).

### B. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–ROME (v1.2 → v1.3)

**Change:** Added Section XI. MEM CONNECTIONS (previously absent); renumbered Bibliography to XII.

**Connections added:**
- **PERSIA WAR corpus:** CARRHAE, WAR–ALEXANDER
- **Other:** DYNASTY–SASANIAN–SHAPUR–I, DYNASTY–SASANIAN–KHOSROW–II, GEO–LEVANT, ARMENIA, PALMYRA, DYNASTY–SASANIAN, EGYPT, ISLAM
- **Breaks if removed:** CARRHAE, GEO–LEVANT, DYNASTY–SASANIAN–KHOSROW–II

### C. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–MARATHON (v1.0 → v1.1)

**Change:** Reorganized MEM CONNECTIONS; added "PERSIA WAR corpus" grouping; added WAR–THERMOPYLAE.

**Connections:** WAR–THERMOPYLAE, WAR–ALEXANDER, IONIAN–REVOLT (corpus); XERXES, DYNASTY, DARIUS–I (other).

### D. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–THERMOPYLAE (v1.0 → v1.1)

**Change:** Reorganized MEM CONNECTIONS; added "PERSIA WAR corpus" grouping; added WAR–ALEXANDER.

**Connections:** WAR–MARATHON, WAR–ALEXANDER (corpus); XERXES, IONIAN–REVOLT, DYNASTY (other).

**Rationale:** Xerxes' failure at Salamis/Plataea precedes Alexander's inversion of the Greek–Persian dynamic.

### E. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–SCYTHIAN (v1.0 → v1.1)

**Change:** Reorganized MEM CONNECTIONS; added "PERSIA WAR corpus" grouping; added WAR–ALEXANDER.

**Connections:** WAR–CARRHAE, WAR–ALEXANDER (corpus); DARIUS–I, GEO–CASPIAN, DYNASTY (other).

**Rationale:** Tempo (Alexander defeats Persia) vs nomadic denial (Scythians defeat Darius)—structural contrast.

### F. MEM–PERSIA–WAR–CARRHAE (v1.2 → v1.3)

**Change:** Reorganized MEM CONNECTIONS; added "PERSIA WAR corpus" grouping; added WAR–SCYTHIAN.

**Connections:** WAR–ROME, WAR–ALEXANDER, WAR–SCYTHIAN (corpus); DYNASTY–SASANIAN, DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID, ZOROASTER, DYNASTY–ACHAEMENID–CYRUS–II, DYNASTY–SASANIAN–SHAPUR–I, DYNASTY–SASANIAN–KHOSROW–II, ARMENIA, ISLAM (other).

**Rationale:** Scythian expedition as denial precedent—nomadic resistance to imperial logic.

### G. CIV–INDEX–PERSIA

**Change:** Added WAR corpus integration note under Section VIII (WAR & CIVILIZATIONAL CONFLICT FILES).

**Text added:**
> WAR corpus (integrated): Ionian Revolt → Marathon → Thermopylae (Greek wars); Scythian (northern denial); Alexander (tempo/conquest); Carrhae (founding Roman–Persian); Rome (seven-century parity). Cross-refs in MEM CONNECTIONS.

### H. VERSION–MANIFEST

**Change:** New entry for 2026-02-01 (PERSIA — WAR CORPUS INTEGRATION) documenting all version bumps and the index update.

## IV. THEMATIC ARC

The integrated corpus now encodes a coherent Persian war memory arc:

1. **Greek wars (499–480 BC):** Ionian Revolt → Marathon (setback) → Thermopylae (tactical victory) — encoding divergence: minor for Persia, foundational for Greece.
2. **Northern frontier (513 BC):** Scythian campaign — nomadic denial; limits of Persian power; precedent for Carrhae.
3. **Conquest shock (334–323 BC):** Alexander — tempo over mass; elite defection; compression failure; seeds siege–endurance doctrine.
4. **Roman–Persian (53 BC–628 AD):** Carrhae founding → seven-century parity → mutual exhaustion → Islamic absorption.

Key cross-themes:
- **Denial doctrine:** Scythians (nomadic) → Carrhae (Parthian cavalry) → Rome (endurance)
- **Encoding divergence:** Marathon/Thermopylae (Greek myth vs Persian minor event)
- **Tempo vs depth:** Alexander (tempo wins) vs Scythians (denial wins) vs Rome (depth/parity)

## V. GOVERNANCE COMPLIANCE

- **CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE:** MEM CONNECTIONS present; Breaks if removed where appropriate
- **CIV–MEM–CORE:** Cross-references follow dependency/necessity format
- **WRITE mode:** Report creation only; no doctrine mutation, no belief extraction
