## Tier 1 — Scriptable Metrics

### 1.1 RLL Citation Counts (cross-references only)

RLLs cited elsewhere in the file (excluding definition lines):

| RLL | Cross-refs | Note |
|-----|------------|------|
| RLL–RUSSIA–0007 | 1 | Activation trigger |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0008 | 1 | Activation trigger |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0009 | 1 | RLL–0033 Related |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0010 | 1 | RLL–0030 interaction |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0011 | 2 | RLL–0016, 0030 |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0012 | 1 | RLL–0033 Related |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0014 | 1 | RLL–0033 Related |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0018 | 1 | GEO audit |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0019 | 1 | GEO audit |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0021 | 1 | GEO audit |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0025 | 3 | Session 0025, RLL–0032, corridor |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0027 | 1 | RLL–0029 Binding |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0029 | 1 | GEO–OB–RIVER, RLL–0027 |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0030 | 2 | Ferguson session, RLL–0010/0011 |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0031 | 1 | GEO–Ladoga |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0032 | 2 | Corridor, GEO ocean audit |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0033 | 1 | Lit cluster synthesis |
| RLL–RUSSIA–0034 | 2 | Romanov synthesis, RLL–0001–0005 Related |

**RLLs with zero cross-references (definition only):** 0001–0006, 0013, 0015–0017, 0024, 0026, 0028. These are core laws; low intra-file citation is expected. No orphan RLLs detected.

### 1.2 MEM Reference Validation

**Cited MEM files verified against corpus (204 MEM–RUSSIA–*.md):**

- All Axiom Derivation MEMs exist: MONGOL–EMPIRE, MUSCOVY–IVAN–IV, ROMANOV–PETER–I, TIME–TROUBLES, BOLSHEVIK–REVOLUTION, GORBACHEV, ROMANOV–NICHOLAS–II, ORTHODOX–CHRISTIANITY, GEO–VOLGA–RIVER, GEO–OKA–RIVER, WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–OPERATION–BARBAROSSA, STALIN.
- All RLL Binding MEMs verified: GEO–URALS, GEO–ALTAI, GEO–CAUCASUS, GEO–CARPATHIANS, GEO–LAKE–LADOGA, GEO–NEVA–RIVER, GEO–DNEIPER–RIVER, GEO–OB–RIVER, WAR–GREAT–PATRIOTIC–LENINGRAD.
- Cross-civilization: MEM–FRANCE–RICHELIEU, MEM–FRANCE–LOUIS–XIV, MEM–GERMANY–HIST–RANKE — assumed present in respective civ folders.

**Gaps (cited but no file):**

| Cited | Context | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
| MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–AFGHAN | NCZ-RU-010 (Legitimacy gain from low-cost victories) | NCZ cites as *example*; MEM not required for NCZ validity. Consider creating or noting "hypothetical case." |
| MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–CHECHNYA | Same | Same as above. |
| MEM–RUSSIA–ALTAI | V.E Proposed MEM Generation Opportunity | Explicitly proposed, not yet created. Expected. |
| MEM–RUSSIA–ENCODING–NORTHERN–LIMIT | V.E Proposed MEM | Same. |

** parsing artifacts (not missing):** MEM–RUSSIA–, MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–Dnieper, GEO–Ladoga, GEO–Volga (case variants), MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–MEM/MEMs — regex extraction noise; actual refs resolve to existing files.

### 1.3 Word Count

- **Declared:** ~13,200 (header)
- **Estimated:** ~13,000–13,500 (per line-count heuristic)
- **Result:** Consistent.

### 1.4 Repeated Phrase Detection (6-gram)

**Substantive repeats (2+ occurrences):**
- "converts interior corridors into usable power" — RLL–0032 definition and reuse; **acceptable** (core law statement).
- "Moscow vs Ladoga chains; Peter vs" — corridor synthesis; **acceptable** (pattern description).

**Template/boilerplate repeats:**
- RLL table headers ("rlls are active and bound", "mem recursive learning laws")
- "civ–scholar–template v3.0 (current) • civ–scholar–protocol"
- "confidence: tier 3 (50–70%). status: draft;"
- "proposed to v. bound recursive learning laws"

**Result:** No actionable redundancy. Template repetition is structural.

## Tier 2 — Semi-Automated Analysis

### 2.1 Session Clustering (by topic)

| Cluster | Sessions | Key MEMs | RLLs |
|---------|----------|----------|------|
| GEO (ocean, river, corridor) | 2026-02 (ocean), 2026-02 (river), 2026-02-04 (Ladoga), 2026-02-03 (White Sea→Baltic) | Arctic, Baltic, Ladoga, Neva, Volga, Ob, Dnieper, Arkhangelsk | 0018, 0019, 0021, 0024, 0027–0029, 0031, 0032 |
| Romanov / legitimacy | 2026-02-16 (Romanov, Richelieu–Peter), 2026-02-03 (Panin, quartet) | Catherine–II, Peter–I, Nicholas–I, Alexander–II/III, Richelieu, Louis–XIV | 0005, 0007, 0009, 0010, 0011, 0033 |
| Rurikid / legitimacy sequencing | 2026-02-16 (Rurikid cluster), 2026-02-02 (recursive hinges) | Novgorod–Rurik, Kievan–Rus, Golden–Horde, Alexander–Nevsky | 0001, 0003, 0004, 0005, 0025, 0034 |
| Panin / Restraint (RLL–0033) | 2026-02-03 (Panin insight), validation runs | Panin, Catherine–II, War–Crimean, Alexander–II/III, Nicholas–I | 0033 |
| Lit / authority models | 2026-02-16 (lit cluster, Tolstoy, Ivan IV vs Panin/Kutuzov) | Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, Pushkin, Kutuzov, Muscovy–Ivan–IV | 0017, 0033 |
| Putin / encoding | 2026-02-03 (Putin, Dostoevsky) | Putin, LIT–DOSTOEVSKY | 0017 |
| CEP / cross-entity | 2026-02-03 (Crooke–Diesen) | Great–Game, Baltic–Sea, Volga–River, Putin | — |

**Coherence:** Sessions cluster logically; no orphan sessions. Overlap (e.g. Panin across Romanov and 0033) is intentional cross-linking.

### 2.2 RLL ↔ MEM Incidence (high-incidence MEMs)

MEMs cited in Axioms, RLL Bindings, NCZ Related MEMs, and Session Source MEMs:

| MEM | Axiom | RLL Binding | NCZ | Session | Total |
|-----|-------|-------------|-----|---------|-------|
| MEM–RUSSIA–ROMANOV–PETER–I | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 4 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–MONGOL–EMPIRE | ✓ | — | — | ✓ | 3 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–TIME–TROUBLES | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | 3 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–BOLSHEVIK–REVOLUTION | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | 2 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–GORBACHEV | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | 2 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–MUSCOVY–IVAN–IV | ✓ | — | ✓ | ✓ | 3 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–STALIN | ✓ | — | ✓ | — | 2 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–GEO–LAKE–LADOGA | — | ✓ | — | ✓ | 2 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–ROMANOV–CATHERINE–II | — | ✓ | — | ✓ | 2 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–WAR–LIVONIAN | — | — | — | ✓ | 2 |
| MEM–RUSSIA–PANIN | — | ✓ | — | ✓ | 2 |

**Result:** High-incidence MEMs align with core axioms and high-traffic sessions. No MEM over-cited to the point of circularity.

## Tier 3 — Manual Review

### 3.1 Contradiction Scan

- **ANOMALY REGISTRY (VI.A):** Empty. No active anomalies flagged.
- **Grep for "contradict", "inconsistent", "incompatible", "conflict":** All hits are procedural (e.g. "does not resolve contradictions", "conflict handling") or RLL internal logic ("institutional contradictions"). No unresolved substantive contradiction identified.
- **RLL ↔ RLL:** Related and Interacts statements (e.g. 0033 ↔ 0009, 0012, 0014) preserve tension; no logical clash.

**Result:** No contradictions requiring remediation.

### 3.2 Derivation Quality (Axiom/RLL → MEM)

**Axioms (IV):**
- Each axiom has 2–3 MEMs in Derivation.
- Scope and Limits are explicit.
- MEMs named in Derivation exist in corpus (see 1.2).

**Bound RLLs (V, V.A, V.C):**
- General RLLs (0001–0011, 0030, 0034): Derivation or Template/MEM references present.
- WAR RLLs (0012–0017): Template and historical examples specified.
- GEO RLLs (0018, 0019, 0021, 0024, 0027–0029): **Binding** MEMs explicit; recursive moves documented.

**Proposed RLLs (V.D):**
- 0025, 0026, 0031, 0032, 0033: LEARN session derivation, Evidence, Binding MEMs, Scope, Status present.
- RLL–0033 validation runs (Alexander–II, Crimean/Nicholas I, Alexander–III) follow coding protocol; results appended.

**Result:** Derivation chain is traceable. MEM citations support claims; no unsupported axiom or RLL detected.

## Recommendations

### Optional (non-blocking)

1. **NCZ WAR–AFGHAN / WAR–CHECHNYA:** Add footnote: "NCZ examples; MEMs not yet in corpus" or create minimal MEMs if NCZ evidence is desired.
2. **RLL cross-reference depth:** Consider adding 1–2 cross-refs for RLLs 0001–0006 in session syntheses where pattern is validated (e.g. 0001 in Rurikid/0034 context).
3. **MEM–RUSSIA–ALTAI, ENCODING–NORTHERN–LIMIT:** Track in V.E; create when resource permits to complete GEO/Subject pair and thematic encoding.

### Maintenance

- Re-run Tier 1 (RLL counts, MEM validation) after major SCHOLAR edits or MEM corpus changes.
- Re-run Tier 3 (contradiction scan) when new RLLs are bound or Axioms revised.
