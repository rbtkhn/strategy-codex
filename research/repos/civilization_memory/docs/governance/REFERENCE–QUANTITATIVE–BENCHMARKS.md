REFERENCE – QUANTITATIVE BENCHMARKS
Civilizational Memory Codex · System Performance & Quality Measurement

Status: ACTIVE · REFERENCE
Version: 1.0
Scope: SYSTEM mode; audits; quality evaluation
Governed by: CMC 3.5 · CIV–MEM–CORE · CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE · CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE
Last Update: February 2026

Purpose: Define quantitative benchmarks to establish and measure the performance and quality of the CIV–MEM system. These benchmarks support audits, compliance checks, and periodic review. They do not replace qualitative judgment; they make it possible to track trends and spot regressions.

V-A. SESSION CONTINUITY BENCHMARKS (cmc-mode-contracts)
────────────────────────────────────────────

Session continuity (retention of prior context across mode/entity switches) is intended to increase connection discovery and unique insights. The following benchmarks measure whether that is occurring.

**Scope:** Sessions that include at least one **entity switch** (e.g. scholar-india → STATE Russia) or **mode switch** (e.g. LEARN → STATE). Single-entity, single-mode sessions are out of scope.

| Benchmark | Definition | Measure | Target (suggested) |
|-----------|------------|---------|--------------------|
| CONTINUITY_CROSS_REFERENCE_RATE | In multi-entity/multi-mode sessions: count of substantive turns (after first switch) where the system explicitly references or connects to content from a **different** entity or from an **earlier** mode (e.g. "Earlier we…", "In India we had…", "The mechanism-failure pattern from scholar-india…") | Count such references; divide by number of substantive turns after first switch; express per 10 turns | ≥1 cross-reference per 10 turns (i.e. continuity is being used to link prior context to current turn) |
| CONTINUITY_CONNECTION_DISCOVERIES | In such sessions: count of explicit **connection statements** that link content from two different entities or two different modes (e.g. India MEM ↔ Russia MEM; SCHOLAR ENTRY ↔ STATE material option; pattern transfer or contrast) | Count per session; sum over sessions; report mean per session | ≥1 cross-entity or cross-mode connection per session (when session has ≥1 switch); track mean and trend |
| CONTINUITY_SPAN | In such sessions: number of distinct **entities** (or **modes**) that appear in any cross-reference or connection statement within the session | Max = entities (or modes) active in session; count how many are explicitly linked in one statement | When session has 2+ entities/modes, CONTINUITY_SPAN ≥ 2 in ≥50% of such sessions (at least one statement spans two entities or modes) |

**Measurement:** Manual audit of session transcript or logged output. Identify: (1) entity/mode switches; (2) turns after first switch; (3) explicit cross-references (to earlier entity/mode); (4) explicit connection statements (linking two entities or two modes). Compute rate and counts per session; aggregate over N sessions.

**Baseline (optional):** Before/after comparison: run the same multi-entity/multi-mode scenario with continuity rule applied vs. with instruction to "re-anchor and do not refer to prior entity/mode"; compare CONTINUITY_CROSS_REFERENCE_RATE and CONTINUITY_CONNECTION_DISCOVERIES. Expect higher values when continuity is retained.

**Metric-gaming risk:** Optimizing for these counts can encourage superficial or forced references that satisfy the metric without adding insight. To mitigate: treat a cross-reference or connection as valid only when it **substantively links** prior context (from another entity or earlier mode) to the current question or analysis—not when it merely names the prior entity or repeats a label. Auditors should flag thin references (e.g. "As we saw in India…" with no analytical carry-forward) as non-counting. The goal is continuity that improves reasoning, not tally-building.

VI. MEASUREMENT METHOD AND FREQUENCY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**Automated or semi-automated (where applicable):**
- Word count, section presence, connection count: script or grep (see COMPLIANCE–REGISTRY IX).
- Options count (8), slot labels: parse of session output or audit script.

**Manual audit (sampled or full):**
- Verbatim %, ARC attribution, voice markers, negative-claim check, MEM SCAN trace, contradiction surfacing.
- Frequency: spot checks during sessions; full benchmark run quarterly or after major batch changes (per COMPLIANCE–REGISTRY).

**Reporting:**
- Results can be recorded in COMPLIANCE–REGISTRY (for MEM counts), in a dedicated RUN–REPORT–BENCHMARKS–YYYY–MM, or in SESSION–LEDGER.
- Targets in this document are suggested; adjust per civilization phase and priority. Update this REFERENCE when criteria or targets change.
