# AUDIT — CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA vs CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE & CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL

**Date:** 2026-02-01  
**Scope:** CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA (absent) vs CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 & CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.6  
**Purpose:** Audit scholar-india against template and protocol; document compliance requirements for creation  
**Anchor:** CIV–MEM–CORE v2.9

---

## I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| **CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA** | **ABSENT** — file does not exist in `content/civilizations/INDIA/` |
| **Content audit** | N/A — no file to audit |
| **Template/Protocol alignment** | N/A until file created |
| **Recommendation** | Create CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA from CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10; declare Phase I; comply with Protocol v2.6 |

**Summary:** CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA is not present in the INDIA civilization folder. The INDIA folder contains CIV–CORE–INDIA.md, CIV–INDEX–INDIA.md, multiple MEM files, and README.md — but no CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA.md. This audit therefore cannot evaluate content or section alignment. Below: (1) confirmation of absence, (2) Template and Protocol requirements that would apply to a new CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA, (3) creation checklist for template/protocol compliance when the file is added.

## II. CONFIRMATION OF ABSENCE

**Location checked:** `content/civilizations/INDIA/`

**Files present in INDIA:**
- CIV–CORE–INDIA.md
- CIV–INDEX–INDIA.md
- MEM–INDIA–* (multiple)
- README.md

**File absent:** CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA.md

**Comparison:** Other civilizations with SCHOLAR files include ANGLIA, FRANCE, GERMANY, ISLAM, PERSIA, ROME, RUSSIA (each has CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV].md). INDIA does not.

**Verdict:** Audit of "scholar-india against scholar-template and protocol" cannot be performed on content. Compliance requirements for a *future* CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA are specified below.

---

## III. TEMPLATE & PROTOCOL REQUIREMENTS (APPLICABLE WHEN FILE EXISTS)

The following derive from CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 and CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.6. They would apply to any newly created CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA.

### III.A CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10 — Binding Requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Authority** | CIV–MEM–CORE → CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE → CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV]. No Scholar file may override MEM law, ARC law, or Template law. |
| **Phase** | File MUST operate within one of: PHASE I (Accumulation), PHASE II (Constraint Grammar), PHASE III (Snapshot). Phases mutually exclusive. Default for new SCHOLAR: Phase I. |
| **RLL** | Namespace-qualified: RLL–INDIA–#### (or RLL–GLOBAL–####). Unqualified RLL–#### deprecated. Scope, constraint type, activation trigger, affected file classes required. |
| **Failure-first** | Phase II: reasoning MUST begin with collapse/breakdown/failure; success cases only to explain non-failure or delayed collapse. |
| **Non-synthesis** | May record contradictions, juxtapose models, preserve tensions. May NOT resolve contradictions, harmonize, or produce unified closure. Constraint-oriented synthesis exempt (per Protocol). |
| **Scholar ↔ MEM conflict** | MEM facts authoritative; SCHOLAR interpretive. Anomaly Flag Protocol REQUIRED in Phase II when conflicts exist. |
| **OGE embedding** | Section XI.A: OGE specification MUST be embedded in every SCHOLAR file. 6-option format; Mearsheimer + Barnes options where applicable; POST-BARNES M/M response options. |
| **Communication register** | LEARN: Mercouris voice, academic prose; exploratory, non-procedural. Voice markers for secondary MIND (BARNES, MEARSHEIMER). |
| **Context loading** | Section XIII: Doctrine Load Protocol, ARC Load Protocol; session startup file sets by operation type (LEARN minimal; WRITE by tier). |
| **Synthesis tradecraft** | Section XIV: Frozen SYNTHESIS must have Assumptions Box; ACH Record when alternatives evaluated; confidence tier (1–4) in status block. |
| **Self-containment** | SCHOLAR file MUST embed specifications for minimal LEARN sessions (no external files required for basic operation). |

### III.B CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.6 — Binding Requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|------|-------------|
| **Phase** | Phase I / II / III; protocol-aware. Phase I: learning, pattern recognition, tension recording, hypothesis staging; no RLL binding, no doctrine, no verdicts. |
| **OGE** | Mandatory; pre-mode interface. Upon entry into any Scholar interaction state, present structured options first. OGE options tagged with mode. |
| **Modes** | LEARN, WRITE, IMAGINE, AUDIT; mutually exclusive. No mode blending. |
| **LEARN** | Only mode in which Scholar learning occurs. Synthesis primary and expected (phase-scoped). Mercouris voice; intellectual creative work. |
| **WRITE** | Canonical output; no learning, no synthesis, no doctrine mutation. |
| **RLL** | RLL–[CIV]–####; binding in Phase II only; explicit user authorization required for binding. |
| **Cognitive interaction** | When another MIND has given analysis: include response option ("X responds to Y—reframe"). POST-BARNES: next OGE must include Mercouris and Mearsheimer response options. |
| **Doctrine** | Scholar may propose doctrine candidates, reference frozen doctrine; may NOT freeze, modify, or override doctrine. |
| **ARC** | Scholar learning bounded by ARC; ARC violations block doctrine eligibility. |

### III.C Header and Structural Expectations (Template)

When creating CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA, the file should include:

- **Filename:** CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA — vX.X  
- **Title:** Civilizational Memory Codex · Scholar Engine · INDIA  
- **Status:** e.g. ACTIVE · WRITE-LOCKED (or as appropriate)  
- **Template Version Used:** CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10  
- **Governed by:** CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.6  
- **Compatibility:** CIV / MEM / SCHOLAR Architecture (CMC v2.2+)  
- **Civilization Phase:** PHASE I (Accumulation) — for new file  
- **Lock Level:** As appropriate (e.g. TOTAL or STRUCTURAL)  
- **Last Update:** Month Year  
- **WORDCOUNT:** Declared  

Template section order (high level): I Purpose & Authority, II Phase Model, III RLL Authority, IV Failure-First (incl. Axiom, Negative Capability, Quantification), V Non-Synthesis, VI Scholar ↔ MEM Conflict, VII Civilization-Scoped Promotion, VIII Snapshot Class, IX Communication Register (voice, OGE, audit commands), X Ephemeral Layer, XI OGE (embedding, entry/synthesis/RLL formats), XII Versioning & Count Tracking, XIII Context Loading Protocols, XIV Synthesis Tradecraft. Optional/ledger sections may follow.

## IV. CREATION CHECKLIST FOR CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA

When creating CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA, use this checklist to align with Template and Protocol from the start:

**Header**
- [ ] Filename CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA — v0.1 (or v1.0)
- [ ] Template Version Used: CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10
- [ ] Governed by: CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.6

- [ ] Civilization Phase: PHASE I (Accumulation)
- [ ] Lock Level stated
- [ ] WORDCOUNT declared
- [ ] Last Update (Month Year) optional

**Phase & authority**
- [ ] Phase I declared (accumulation; no RLL binding; no doctrine creation)
- [ ] Authority flow: CIV–MEM–CORE → Template → CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA

**RLL**
- [ ] RLL namespace: RLL–INDIA–#### (no unqualified RLL–####)
- [ ] When RLLs are proposed: scope, constraint type, activation trigger, affected file classes

**OGE**
- [ ] OGE specification embedded (8 options A–H; M+B where applicable; POST-BARNES M/M response options)
- [ ] Entry addition format, synthesis drafting format, RLL proposal format (Template XI.B–D)

**Voice & communication**
- [ ] LEARN: Mercouris academic prose (CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS III.L)
- [ ] Voice markers for secondary MIND: [LEARN MODE — BARNES CATALYST], [LEARN MODE — MEARSHEIMER SHARPENING], etc.

**Conflict & doctrine**
- [ ] Scholar ↔ MEM: MEM authoritative; Anomaly Flag Protocol noted (required in Phase II when conflicts exist)
- [ ] Doctrine: Scholar does not freeze doctrine; may propose candidates, reference frozen

**Context loading**
- [ ] Doctrine Load Protocol and ARC Load Protocol acknowledged (Template XIII); session startup sets by mode

**Synthesis tradecraft (when synthesis is frozen)**
- [ ] Assumptions Box for frozen SYNTHESIS (Template XIV.A)
- [ ] ACH Record when alternatives evaluated (XIV.B)
- [ ] Confidence tier in status block (XIV.C)

**Cross-references**

## V. RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

1. **Create CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA** from CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE v2.10, using the checklist in Section IV. Place in `content/civilizations/INDIA/CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA.md`.
2. **Set Phase I** explicitly; do not bind RLLs until Phase II is authorized.
3. **Embed OGE** and voice/audit specs per Template § IX and § XI so minimal LEARN sessions are self-contained.
4. **Re-audit** after creation: run this audit again against the new file to verify header, section order, and protocol compliance.

## VI. SUMMARY TABLE

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA exists | ❌ No |
| Content audit (sections, RLL, OGE) | N/A |
| Header compliance | N/A |
| Template v2.10 alignment | N/A |
| Protocol v2.6 alignment | N/A |
| Creation checklist provided | ✓ Yes |
| Recommendation | Create from template; declare Phase I; comply with Protocol v2.6 |

**Verdict:** CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA cannot be audited against template and protocol because the file does not exist. Requirements and a creation checklist are documented above for use when the file is added.

---

## VII. IMPLEMENTATION RECORD (2026-02-01)

**Created:** CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA v2.0 at `content/civilizations/INDIA/CIV–SCHOLAR–INDIA.md`.

**Structure:** Phase I accumulation ledger; Template v2.10 § I–XIV implemented; OGE embedded (§ XI); RLL–INDIA–#### namespace declared for Phase II; Initial State (§ XV) references CIV–INDEX–INDIA v1.1 (13 MEMs); Ingested Learning Events (§ XVI), Belief Synthesis Log (§ XVII), Doctrine Registry (§ XVIII), SDI (§ XIX) empty and ready for accumulation; Governance & Lock State (§ XX); Count Tracking (§ XXI). CIV–CORE–INDIA v2.0 diagnostics referenced; ARC Reference: CIV–ARC–INDIA (if present).

**Next:** Re-run this audit against the new file to verify header and section compliance with Template v2.10 and Protocol v2.6.
