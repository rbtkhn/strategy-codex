I. PURPOSE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
This document records the results of a terminology audit conducted
in February 2026 and establishes a binding gate for future term
introduction.

The audit applied a single test to every internal term in the CMC:
**Does the plain-English alternative lose precision?** If not, the
term is decoration and should be replaced.

This test derives from standard plain-language practice (Bryan Garner,
UK Plain English Campaign, US Plain Writing Act 2010) and parallels
NATO's doctrinal vocabulary discipline (Allied Joint Publication-01),
where every defined term must justify its existence against the
plain-language alternative.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
II. LOAD-BEARING TERMS (KEEP)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These terms compress genuine complexity that plain English cannot
match without repeated explanation or loss of precision. They are
the system's terms of art.

| Term | Full Name | Why It Earns Its Place |
|------|-----------|----------------------|
| MEM | Memory file | Specific governed file type with connection requirements, quotation minimums, blend proportions. "Historical memory file" doesn't capture that a MEM is a governed object, not just a document. |
| GEO–MEM | Geographic memory file | Subtype of MEM with different blend proportions (2/3 Mearsheimer) and ARC requirements. The distinction from subject MEM does real analytical work. |
| RLL | Recursive Learning Law | A pattern extracted from learning that becomes *binding*. "Learning rule" misses the recursion and the binding authority. No plain equivalent. |
| ARC | Academic Reference Canon | Quotation hierarchy with era requirements (4 eras), minimum word counts, and doctrine-gating function. "Bibliography" misses all of this. |
| CIV–CORE | Civilization core engine | Houses axioms, diagnostics, constraint gates. "Civilization file" doesn't capture that it's an engine, not a description. |
| CIV–SCHOLAR | SCHOLAR file | Learning ledger with structured entries, syntheses, RLL proposals, and confidence levels. "Learning file" undershoots the governance. |
| CIV–DOCTRINE | Doctrine registry | Registry of accepted doctrines (permanent except when user explicitly modifies). Doctrines derive from syntheses accepted by DIB; evidence gating applies. Synthesis is by definition evolving; axiom and doctrine are permanent. **Deprecated:** "frozen"/"unfrozen" — use "accepted as doctrine" and "permanent" / "evolving" instead. |
| CIV–STATE | STATE file | Decision-support file that serves as cognitive exoskeleton for the head of state: extends the principal's cognitive reach (options, precedent, disconfirming evidence) without substituting for judgment. Distinct temporal orientation (present), register, and audience from SCHOLAR. Renamed from CIV–COUNSEL (2026-02-11). |
| CIV–INDEX | Index file | Registration file. Self-explanatory as file-type name. |
| CIV–ARC | ARC file | Per-civilization academic reference canon. Self-explanatory as file-type name. |

NOTE: File-type names (MEM, GEO–MEM, CIV–CORE, CIV–SCHOLAR, etc.)
are load-bearing by nature — they are namespace identifiers for
governed objects. The audit focused on *conceptual* terms used in
governance prose and analytical output.

**Caps consistency:** When referring to the CIV–SCHOLAR–[CIV] and
CIV–STATE–[CIV] files in prose, use **SCHOLAR** and **STATE** in all
caps (e.g. "STATE learns from SCHOLAR"; "the SCHOLAR file"; "information
enters SCHOLAR from STATE only via relay").

DEPRECATED (February 2026):

**"Harvest"** — Removed from STATE→SCHOLAR transfer terminology. Use
**"relay"**, **"relay to scholar"**, **"relay to scholar–[entity]"**, or
**"relay to learn mode"** instead. Legacy aliases ("harvest", "harvest
session") remain accepted for backward compatibility but avoid in new text.

**"Frozen" / "unfrozen"** — Removed from synthesis/doctrine terminology.
Synthesis is by definition evolving; axiom and doctrine are permanent
except when the user explicitly modifies them. Use **"accepted as
doctrine"** (synthesis promoted to doctrine by DIB), **"permanent"**
(axiom/doctrine), and **"evolving"** (synthesis) instead.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
III. DECORATIVE TERMS (REPLACE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
These terms rename ordinary concepts without adding precision.
Replace with the plain-English equivalent in all governance
documents, cursor rules, and templates.

| Term | Plain Replacement | Why It Doesn't Earn Its Place |
|------|-------------------|-------------------------------|
| OGE (Option Generation Engine) | Options menu | "Option Generation Engine" mystifies a simple concept: presenting choices to the user. |
| DEF (Doctrinal Eligibility Filter) | Evidence requirement for doctrine | Three letters obscuring a straightforward gate. |
| DIB (Doctrine Intake Buffer) | Doctrine gateway | Nobody remembers what this stands for without looking it up. That is the test. |
| SCL (Scholar Confidence Level) | Confidence rating | Self-explanatory concept given an unnecessary acronym. |
| POST-BARNES | After liability analysis | Requires knowing who Barnes is and what "post" means in this context. "After liability analysis" is immediately clear. |
| TRI-FRAME | Three-perspective analysis | The plain version is actually more descriptive than the jargon. |
| CATALYST SEQUENCE | Analysis sequence (legitimacy → power → liability → legitimacy) | Borrowed metaphor adding no precision over a description of the sequence. |
| POLYPHONIC TENSION | Preserved contradictions / unresolved tensions | Literary theory import that obscures a clear concept. |
| CCM (Cross-Civilizational Misperception) | Cross-civilizational misperception | The full phrase is already plain; the acronym saves nothing. |
| BLEND LAW | Content proportion rule | "Law" overstates its authority; it is a formatting guideline for MEM content ratios. Borderline — "law" carries enforcement weight, but the plain version is adequate. |

IV. IMPLEMENTATION RULES
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

A. REPLACEMENT PROTOCOL

When replacing decorative terms in governance files:

1. Replace the decorative term with the plain equivalent
2. On first occurrence in a document, include the legacy term in
   parentheses for transition: "options menu (formerly OGE)"
3. After a transition period (one governance cycle), remove the
   parenthetical legacy reference
4. File-type names (CIV–CORE, MEM, etc.) are never replaced;
   only conceptual/procedural terms are subject to replacement

B. SCOPE

The replacement applies to:
• Governance documents (BOOTSTRAP, CIV–MEM–CORE, VERSION–MANIFEST)
• Templates (CIV–MEM–TEMPLATE, CIV–SCHOLAR–TEMPLATE, CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE)
• Cursor rules (.cursor/rules/cmc-*)
• Protocols and proposals

The replacement does NOT apply to:
• MEM content files (these use load-bearing file-type names, not
  procedural jargon)
• CIV–STATE files (already governed by external-facing register
  rules that prohibit system-internal vocabulary)

C. CURSOR RULE FILENAMES

Cursor rule filenames that reference decorative terms (e.g.,
cmc-oge-enforcement.mdc) should be renamed to use plain equivalents
(e.g., cmc-options-menu.mdc) in the next governance cycle.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
V. NEW-TERM GATE (BINDING)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
No new internal term may be introduced to the CMC unless the
proposer demonstrates that:

1. The plain-English alternative is genuinely insufficient —
   it either loses precision, requires repeated multi-word
   explanation, or creates ambiguity with an existing concept
2. The term compresses a specific governed concept — not merely
   a process step or ordinary idea
3. The term is pronounceable or immediately parseable — if you
   cannot remember what it stands for without looking it up,
   it fails the gate

PROCEDURE:
• Proposer states: (a) the new term, (b) the plain alternative,
  (c) why the plain alternative is insufficient
• If the plain alternative works, use it
• If the new term passes the gate, add it to Section II of
  this registry with its justification

This gate applies to all governance documents, templates, cursor
rules, and protocols. It does not apply to file-type names, which
are namespace identifiers governed by the FILE NAMING CONVENTION
in CMC–BOOTSTRAP.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
VI. EXTERNAL-FACING REGISTER (STATE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
CIV–STATE files are governed by a stricter standard: no
system-internal terminology in analytical prose. This includes
both load-bearing and decorative terms.

In STATE files, use:
• "Legitimacy and institutional continuity" (not "Mercouris lens")
• "Power distribution and structural constraint" (not "Mearsheimer lens")
• "Leadership liability and mechanism" (not "Barnes lens")
• "Three analytical perspectives" (not "tri-frame" or "MIND profiles")
• "Structured options" (not "options menu" or "OGE")
• "Historical memory" (not "MEM") — except as source citation

Source citations may use file-type names:
• "Source: MEM–RUSSIA–ROMANOV–PETER–I" — PERMITTED
• "The MEM analysis suggests..." — PROHIBITED (use "The historical
  analysis suggests...")

See CIV–STATE–TEMPLATE Section XI for the full register rules
and translation table.
