# Option Generation Engine (OGE) — Unified Architecture v1.9
## Multi-Mode Option Generation System

**Version:** 1.9
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-04
**Upgrade:** 8 OPTIONS — E/F/G TRAVERSAL, H SYNTHESIS

---

### Upgrade Note (v1.9)

OGE expanded from 6 to **8 options**. A, B, C, D unchanged. New structure:
- **E** — Traverse backward in time (build response on relevant same-civ MEM)
- **F** — Traverse forward in time (build response on relevant same-civ MEM)
- **G** — Traverse to different civilization (build response on relevant cross-civ MEM)
- **H** — Synthesis (formerly F): recap + follow-on options; full execution rules

E, F, G require response built on traversed-to MEM file. Historical anchor applies to A–G (not H).

### Upgrade Note (v1.8)

Options A, B, C now have **explicit response formats** and **MIND load requirement**. When A, B, or C is selected: (1) Load the designated MIND file; (2) Response MUST satisfy voice and lens requirements therein; (3) Length 100–200 words; (4) Frame per table below. See "Options A, B, C — Response Format (BINDING)" below.

### Upgrade Note (v1.7)

Option D is now a **standardized multi-mind response**. When D is selected, the response MUST follow the 4-part structure: Mercouris (1–2 sent) → Mearsheimer responds (1–2 sent) → Barnes responds (1–2 sent) → Mercouris wrap-up (1–2 sent). D option text remains 6–10 words, context-specific; the *response format* is fixed. E remains time/space navigation.

### Upgrade Note (v1.6)

Option F synthesis follow-on options are now **size/risk-based**:
- **(a)** No change — recap only
- **(b)** Small incremental — structured state, behavioral effect, elevation path
- **(c)** Bigger change — SYNTHESIS block, RLL proposal, doctrine candidate

Additions: escalation after (b), cross-session discovery of pending (b), return path clarification, advisory guidance, minimum (b) requirement, explicit feedback. Protocol specifies size; system designs implementation. See "Option F — Synthesis Implementation Options" below.

### Upgrade Note (v1.5)

Recursive scholar modification operations are now **canonical and standardized**.
See Section "Recursive Modification Operations (BINDING)" below.
Option F follow-on options use size/risk framing (v1.6 supersedes labels).

### Upgrade Note (v1.4)

Option F in LEARN mode now triggers SCHOLAR file integration pathways:
- Response includes 6–10 word recap + fuller synthesis paragraph (<100 words)
- Integration pathways presented as offers: draft SYNTHESIS entry, propose RLL, evaluate doctrine proposal
- User must explicitly choose to proceed; no auto-execution
- Omit integration pathways if session lacked substantive learning

### Upgrade Note (v1.3)

This version hardens the OGE ontology:
- **Options guide, not predict** — Options direct the creation of the next response; they are productive, not descriptive
- **Options A/B/C derived from MIND files** — CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, CIV–MIND–BARNES are the authoritative source for option phrasing
- **Pipeline:** MIND file → option text → response
- **Alignment:** Same source governs option phrasing and response content

### Upgrade Note (v1.2)

This version standardizes the first three OGE options across all modes:
- **A** = Mercouris, **B** = Mearsheimer, **C** = Barnes (always)
- D, E, F = context-specific
- POST-BARNES: A and B shift to "responds to Barnes"
- Simplifies MIND slot enforcement; eliminates variability in option order

### Upgrade Note (v1.1)

This version adds the **Cognitive Skills Registry** — a formal catalog of invokable
cognitive operations. Skills are the building blocks of OGE options and REASON layer
operations, enabling explicit skill invocation and consistent behavior.

v1.1 introduces:
- MIND Invocation Skills (apply lens, responds to, tri-frame)
- Synthesis Skills (synthesize patterns, propose RLL, cross-civ compare)
- Audit Skills (ARC compliance, connection gaps, Mearsheimer/Barnes audit)
- Production Skills (generate MEM, enhance MEM, upgrade version)
- Skill Invocation Protocol
- Skill registration process
- Integration with READ/REASON layers

Cross-ref: CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL v2.5 (XIV-A READ/REASON LAYER)

## Purpose

The Option Generation Engine (OGE) is a unified, mode-agnostic mechanism that drives user interaction through context-aware multiple choice options across all three modes: IMAGINE, LEARN, and WRITE.

**Core Principle:** Multiple choice options are a **driving mechanism** for each mode, but the **types of options** differ according to mode context and purpose.

---

## Unified Architecture

### OGE Definition

The Option Generation Engine (OGE) is a non-epistemic, non-authoritative interaction mechanism that:
- Structures user pathways through context-aware options
- Prevents silent monologic collapse
- Preserves user agency through explicit choices
- Adapts option types to mode-specific requirements

OGE generates options, not conclusions.

---

## OGE Ontology (v1.3 — BINDING)

**Options guide, not predict.** An option does not describe what will happen; it **guides the creation** of the next response. When the user selects an option, that choice is a directive—the responder produces output that fulfills it. Options are productive; they shape the conversation.

**Options A/B/C are derived from the relevant MIND file.** CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS, CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER, and CIV–MIND–BARNES are the **authoritative source** for how to phrase options A, B, C. Option text is generated *according to* each MIND profile—its analytical posture, key questions, and lens. The pipeline: **MIND file → option text → response**. The option is the bridge; it must be faithful to the MIND file.

**Alignment.** The same source governs both option phrasing and response content. Options and responses are coherent because they share the MIND file as origin.

**User may manually interject.** Options are a scaffold, not a cage. The user may type any question, instruction, or command instead of selecting A–H. The system MUST accept free-form input and respond to it as a directive. OGE optimizes optionality; it does not restrict it.

### Free-Form Command Mapping

Treat natural-language variants of option types as valid directives. Common mappings:

| User says | Equivalent to | Notes |
|-----------|---------------|-------|
| "Apply Mearsheimer" / "Mearsheimer lens" / "Structural view" | Option B | Mearsheimer analysis |
| "Barnes on this" / "Apply Barnes" / "Who's liable?" | Option C | Triggers POST-BARNES; next OGE includes M/M response options |
| "Apply Mercouris" / "Legitimacy angle" | Option A | Mercouris analysis |
| "Synthesize" / "Summarize the session" | Option H | 6–10 word recap + synthesis |
| "Load MEM–X" / "Open MEM–PERSIA–GEO–CASPIAN" | Navigation | Explicit file load |
| "Compare to [civ/event]" | D or E | Cross-civilization or time/space navigation |
| "Continue" / "Go deeper" / "Elaborate" | Extension | Continue current thread |
| "Switch to LEARN/IMAGINE/WRITE" | Mode change | Mode transition |

The system MUST accept these as directives and respond appropriately. OGE options are a scaffold; free-form input is always permitted.

## Standardized First Three Options (v1.2)

**A, B, C are fixed in every OGE menu:**
- **A** — Mercouris (CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS)
- **B** — Mearsheimer (CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER)
- **C** — Barnes (CIV–MIND–BARNES)

**Options A, B, C — Response Format (BINDING · v1.8):**
When A, B, or C is selected: (1) **MIND load:** Load the designated MIND file; response MUST satisfy voice and lens requirements therein. (2) **Response format:**

| Option | MIND | Response | Frame | Register |
|--------|------|----------|-------|----------|
| **A** | CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS | 100–200 words | Legitimacy/civilizational; institutional continuity | Hedged (It seems to me...; Perhaps...) |
| **B** | CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER | 100–200 words | Structural/power; force ratios; incentive structure | Direct (The fact is...; minimal hedging) |
| **C** | CIV–MIND–BARNES | 100–200 words | Liability/mechanism; constraint hierarchy; exposure | Blunt, sardonic; full Barnes fingerprint |

Authority: MIND files are canonical. Governance references them; does not duplicate. Violation: voice bleed (e.g. Mercouris using "The fact is") or frame mismatch.

**Historical anchor (A, B, C, D, E, F, G responses):** MUST cite at least one named person, place, or event. MEM preferred; web search when no related MEM. Minimal format: "(e.g. Peter/Petersburg 1703)". Exceptions: short confirmations, H recap, user skip, no source found. See cmc-scholar-mode.

Options D, E, F, G, H are context-specific. **Exactly 8 options** (A–H) in LEARN mode.

**POST-BARNES:** After Barnes interjection, A and B shift: "Mercouris responds to Barnes", "Mearsheimer responds to Barnes". Slots stay fixed; phrasing is contextual.

**D, E, F, G, H standardized (v1.9):**
- **D** — Multi-mind response (BINDING format · v1.7). Option text: 6–10 words, context-specific. **Response format when D selected:** (1) Mercouris 1–2 sentences; (2) Mearsheimer 1–2 sentences responding to Mercouris; (3) Barnes 1–2 sentences responding to either/both; (4) Mercouris 1–2 sentences wrap-up. Total: ~6–10 sentences.
- **E** — Traverse backward in time. **Response format:** Build response on relevant same-civilization MEM file (earlier era). Load traversed-to MEM; response scaffolds from its content; 100–200 words; historical anchor from MEM.
- **F** — Traverse forward in time. **Response format:** Build response on relevant same-civilization MEM file (later era). Load traversed-to MEM; response scaffolds from its content; 100–200 words; historical anchor from MEM.
- **G** — Traverse to different civilization. **Response format:** Build response on relevant cross-civilization MEM file. Load traversed-to MEM; response scaffolds from its content; 100–200 words; historical anchor from MEM.
- **H** — Synthesis (top-level). 6–10 word recap + synthesis paragraph + follow-on options (b, c, a). Functions as optional stopping: user may "cash out" with synthesis at any point.

**Option H — Synthesis (top-level):** Option H = Synthesis. Knowledge and understanding from the Scholar LEARN session are synthesized into the SCHOLAR file. The protocol specifies the **size of change**; the system designs the **optimal specific implementation** to meet the requirement.

**Synthesis implementation options (size/risk-based · BINDING · v1.6):**

| Option | Size | Protocol requirement | System designs |
|--------|------|----------------------|----------------|
| **(a)** | No change | Recap only; nothing written to Scholar | Return to standard OGE |
| **(b)** | Small incremental (low-risk) | Creates structured state with behavioral effect. Minimum: at least one named draft item + explicit elevation path. | Session entry, draft synthesis/pending pattern, etc. Output must be discoverable in subsequent LEARN sessions |
| **(c)** | Bigger change | Formal SYNTHESIS block, RLL proposal, doctrine candidate | Assumptions Box, ACH, Confidence; RLL in PROPOSED; doctrine candidate. RLL = always (c). (c) doctrine path may require WRITE mode |

**Option order:** Present **(b), (c), (a)** — do-something options first, exit last.

**H in LEARN mode — SCHOLAR file integration (v1.6, v1.9):**
When user selects H in LEARN mode, the response MUST:
1. Deliver the 6–10 word session recap
2. Provide a fuller synthesis paragraph (<100 words) encapsulating patterns, tensions, and anchor points from the session
3. **Advisory guidance (optional):** Scholar may suggest (b) vs (c) based on session: "Session suggests (b) — draft pattern ready" or "Session suggests (c) — RLL warranted"
4. Present exactly **three follow-on options** in order **(b), (c), (a)**:
   - **b)** Small incremental — Create structured state (named draft + elevation path)
   - **c)** Bigger change — Formal SYNTHESIS, RLL proposal, or doctrine candidate
   - **a)** No change — Recap only; return to standard OGE

**Execution:**
- **(a):** Return to standard 8-option OGE (A–H). Synthesis is a checkpoint, not session end.
- **(b):** Execute; produce at least one named draft + explicit elevation path. **Explicit feedback:** Confirm what was created and elevation path ("Added draft [X]. Elevation path: propose as RLL in future (c)."). Return to standard OGE. **Escalation prompt:** Offer one-off "Elevate to (c) now?"
- **(c):** For doctrine path, note WRITE mode may be required. **Confirmation (implementation):** System MAY preview before write ("I will add: RLL-0033 draft... Proceed?"). Execute; return to standard OGE.

**Return path:** After (a), (b), or (c), user always returns to standard OGE. Synthesis is a checkpoint; session may continue.

**Cross-session discovery (MANDATORY):** Pending (b) output MUST be discoverable in subsequent LEARN sessions. Context loading must include pending drafts; OGE MAY offer "Continue from pending draft [X]" or "Elevate draft to RLL" as options.

If session lacked substantive learning, deliver recap only; omit or disable (b) and (c).

**Legacy OP–RECURSE–* mapping (reference):** (a) = OP–RECURSE–NONE; (b) = small incremental structured state; (c) = OP–RECURSE–SYNTHESIS / OP–RECURSE–RLL / OP–RECURSE–DOCTRINE.

**OGE response length:** When user selects an OGE option (a–h), response = 100-200 words. Shorter response reduces cognitive load, preserves context window, and avoids truncation. Exception: H in LEARN — 300–400 target. Free-form user input retains 200-400 target, 500 max.

**OGE style:**
- 6–10 words per option; specific preview of next response
- MIND-shaped: A = legitimacy, B = structure/power, C = liability
- Navigate through time and space — user feels movement, optionality
- **At least one concrete anchor per option** — person, place, or event (e.g. Churchill, Caspian, 1945 election). Concrete anchors keep the user engaged and guide/restrain the system better.

## Unified OGE Rules

### Common Constraints (All Modes)

OGE-generated options MUST:
- Always present A, B, C as Mercouris, Mearsheimer, Barnes (or M/M responds to Barnes when POST-BARNES)
- Be clearly enumerated (a, b, c, d, etc.)
- Be mutually distinct
- Be contextually relevant
- Stop and await user selection
- Not proceed unilaterally

OGE-generated options MAY NOT:
- Introduce beliefs (LEARN mode exception: pattern extraction)
- Resolve contradictions (preserve SCL)
- Freeze doctrine without explicit user approval
- Rank interpretations implicitly
- Bypass mode-specific constraints

### Presentation Format

All options MUST follow this format (8 options in LEARN mode):
```
Options (6–10 words each; specific preview; time/space navigation):
a) [Mercouris: legitimacy/civilizational preview of next response]
b) [Mearsheimer: structure/power preview]
c) [Barnes: liability/mechanism preview]
d) [Multi-mind response on topic X—triggers 4-part format: M → M' → B → M wrap-up]
e) [Traverse backward in time—build on earlier same-civ MEM]
f) [Traverse forward in time—build on later same-civ MEM]
g) [Traverse to different civilization—build on cross-civ MEM]
h) [6–10 word session recap—synthesis + follow-on options]

Type a letter (a–h) to select, or type any question/instruction—manual interjection always permitted.
```

### Persistence

- Options persist after LLM response unless new options are provided
- Standard options are automatically re-presented if LLM doesn't generate new ones
- Context-aware options adapt to current state (e.g., compliance status)

---

## Implementation Architecture

### System Prompt Integration

OGE requirements are integrated into mode-specific system prompts:

**IMAGINE Mode:**
- OGE activation mandatory
- Creative exploration options
- Visual/narrative focus

**LEARN Mode:**
- OGE activation mandatory
- Pattern/synthesis options
- Knowledge extraction focus

**WRITE Mode:**
- OGE activation mandatory
- Compliance/modification options
- File management focus

### Frontend Integration

**ScholarInterface.tsx:**
- Auto-generates standard options when MEM file loaded
- Context-aware option generation (e.g., "Upgrade to compliance" after audit)
- Persistent option display
- Option selection handlers

**Option Generation Logic:**
- Mode-specific option generators
- Context detection (compliance status, file state, etc.)
- Standard option sets per mode
- Dynamic option adaptation

---

## Migration from IOGE

### Current State
- IOGE exists only for IMAGINE mode
- LEARN and WRITE modes have no option generation
- Options are manually generated by LLM in IMAGINE mode

### Target State
- Unified OGE covers all three modes
- Mode-specific option types
- Consistent option generation across modes
- Context-aware option adaptation

### Migration Steps

1. **Rename IOGE → OGE** in CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL
2. **Expand OGE section** to cover all three modes
3. **Define mode-specific option classes** for LEARN and WRITE
4. **Update system prompts** to require OGE in all modes
5. **Update frontend** to generate mode-specific options
6. **Update codebase** to handle options in all modes

---

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Interaction Model:** All modes use options as primary interaction mechanism
2. **User Agency:** Users always have clear choices, preventing silent monologic collapse
3. **Mode-Specific Adaptation:** Options adapt to mode purpose while maintaining consistency
4. **Context Awareness:** Options reflect current state (compliance, patterns, file status)
5. **Scalability:** Easy to add new option types or modes

---

## Cognitive Skills Registry (NEW · v1.1)

Cognitive skills are formalized, invokable operations that transform input into structured output. Skills are the building blocks of OGE options and REASON layer operations.

### Skill Definition

A cognitive skill is defined by:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **skill_id** | Unique identifier (e.g., `APPLY_MEARSHEIMER_LENS`) |
| **invocation** | Natural language trigger (e.g., "apply Mearsheimer cognition to X") |
| **input** | Required input type (MEM, topic, comparison pair, etc.) |
| **output** | Expected output type (analysis, OGE options, MEM text, etc.) |
| **mind** | Which MIND(s) execute the skill |
| **mode_availability** | Which modes may invoke the skill |
| **post_skill** | What happens after (OGE, revert, etc.) |

### Registered Skills

#### MIND Invocation Skills

| Skill ID | Invocation | Input | Output | Mind | Modes | Post-Skill |
|----------|------------|-------|--------|------|-------|------------|
| `APPLY_MEARSHEIMER_LENS` | "apply Mearsheimer cognition to [X]" | topic/MEM | structural analysis | MEARSHEIMER | LEARN, WRITE | auto-revert to MERCOURIS |
| `APPLY_BARNES_LENS` | "apply Barnes lens to [X]" | topic/MEM | liability analysis | BARNES | LEARN, WRITE, IMAGINE | M/M response options |

|----------|------------|-------|--------|------|-------|------------|
| `SYNTHESIZE_PATTERNS` | "synthesize patterns across [MEMs]" | MEM list | pattern synthesis | MERCOURIS | LEARN | OGE |
| `PROPOSE_RLL` | "propose RLL from [pattern]" | pattern | candidate RLL | MERCOURIS | LEARN | OGE |
| `CROSS_CIV_COMPARE` | "compare [X] across [CIV1, CIV2]" | MEMs from different civs | comparative analysis | MERCOURIS | LEARN | OGE |

#### Audit Skills

|----------|------------|-------|--------|------|-------|------------|
| `AUDIT_ARC_COMPLIANCE` | "audit ARC compliance of [MEM]" | MEM | pass/fail + recommendations | MERCOURIS | WRITE, LEARN | fix options (WRITE) |
| `AUDIT_CONNECTION_GAPS` | "audit connections of [MEM]" | MEM | gap list + suggestions | MERCOURIS | WRITE, LEARN | fix options (WRITE) |

| `ENHANCE_MEM` | "enhance [MEM] with [source]" | MEM + source | enhanced MEM | MERCOURIS/MEARSHEIMER (blend) | WRITE | OGE |
| `UPGRADE_MEM_VERSION` | "upgrade [MEM] to v[X]" | MEM | upgraded MEM | MERCOURIS | WRITE | OGE |

### Skill Invocation Protocol

1. **Recognition:** System recognizes skill invocation from user input
2. **Validation:** Check mode availability and input requirements
3. **Execution:** Execute skill with specified MIND
4. **Post-Skill:** Apply post-skill behavior (OGE, revert, etc.)

### Adding New Skills

To register a new cognitive skill:

1. Define skill_id (unique, SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
2. Specify natural language invocation pattern
3. Define input/output types
4. Assign executing MIND(s)
5. Specify mode availability
6. Define post-skill behavior
7. Add to appropriate skill category table above

### Skill Interaction with READ/REASON Layers

Skills operate at the REASON layer (see CIV–SCHOLAR–PROTOCOL XIV-A):
- Skills MAY call READ layer operations to access MEM graph
- Skills produce REASON layer outputs (analysis, OGE, MEM text)
- Skills respect mode permissions and phase constraints

---

## Future Enhancements

- **Option History:** Track which options users select to improve generation
- **Smart Defaults:** Learn from user behavior to prioritize option types
- **Cross-Mode Options:** Options that facilitate mode transitions
- **Batch Operations:** Options that trigger multiple actions
- **Skill Chaining:** Define multi-step skill sequences
- **Skill Parameters:** Optional parameters for skill customization
