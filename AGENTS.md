# AGENTS.md â€” AI Coding Assistant Guardrails

This file defines rules for any AI coding assistant working on this repository.

**Repo vs template:** The upstream [`companion-self/AGENTS.md`](companion-self/AGENTS.md) is a minimal portable stub for the template repo. This file is the **authoritative** Layer-1 contract for the `strategy-codex` repo and its embedded Grace-Mar reference instance. When companion-self changes, merge **selective** updates by hand; do not overwrite this file with the template on bulk sync - see [`docs/merging-from-companion-self.md`](docs/merging-from-companion-self.md) section 1.

**For conceptual clarity:** Read `docs/conceptual-framework.md` â€” Record vs. fork, Voice vs. bot, fork vs. twin, terminology. **Prime directive:** The Record belongs to the companion (GRACE-MAR-CORE Â§I).

**For system design:** Read `docs/architecture.md` (includes forced-absorption risk pattern and convenience-path defenses). For the formal skill modularity model (THINK/WRITE boundaries, separate work/execution layer, Voice and profile as functions of skill-write, invariants), see `docs/skills-modularity.md`.

**For local-first sovereignty:** Read `docs/sovereignty.md` â€” memory and governance stay local; cloud/frontier models are helpers, not owners of the Record.

**For chat/UI design:** Read `docs/chat-first-design.md` â€” principles for delivering the full experience within Telegram/chat (bounded sessions, one-tap, Record felt not seen).

**Design alignment:** This repo still carries the Grace-Mar instance and its 5000 Days framing - abundance, identity beyond productivity, conductor workflow, symbiosis (human holds the reins), interregnum fortification (Part 14). See invariants 5-23 and 36 in conceptual-framework.md.

**Triadic cognition:** **Mind** (human) + **Record** + **Voice** - a **triad** (one human part, two digital parts). The Grace-Mar reference instance inside this repo **hosts** Record and Voice for that companion; the companion-self **architecture** defines how those digital parts work across instances. The **WORK execution layer** (operator, assistant, scripts on skill-work and WORK territories) is **instrumental** (drafts, stages); **not** a fourth part of the triad. **Companion self** = human-computer triadic cognition. **Tricameral mind** is an accepted synonym (e.g. prompts). Mind holds authority; the Record reflects; the Voice speaks when queried. The current Voice is reactive; future versions may include agentic Voice modalities (distinct from skill-work execution). New features should reinforce this structure. See CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK invariant 35, 37, 38, and section 8.

**SKILLS (Record-bound):** **self-skill-think**, **self-skill-write**, **self-skill-work**, and **self-skill-steward** (STEWARD â€” governance literacy at the gate; optional split template; **not** merge authority) are capability surfaces at the repository root; see [id-taxonomy.md](docs/id-taxonomy.md), [skills-modularity.md](docs/skills-modularity.md). **THINK doctrine (intake vs identity vs WORK):** [docs/skill-think/README.md](docs/skill-think/README.md). **Skill lifecycle (discovery ladder):** `skills-portable/README.md` â€” pointer â†’ draft â†’ listed. **Skill validation:** `python3 scripts/validate_skills.py`.

**Agent vocabulary (onboarding):** Many new AI users already use **agent** for â€œa tool-using runner.â€ **Work agent** and **skill-work agent** are **onboarding-friendly** names for that pattern on **WORK** surfaces: they **utilize** the Record (read; propose via the gate only) and may support the Voice (e.g. harnesses, PRP, prompt work) under **operator** control â€” they are **not** Mind, **not** the companion-facing Voice in chat, and **not** a fourth triad seat. **Skill-work agent** stresses the same idea scoped to **`docs/skill-work/`** and **WORK territories**, including **replicated / parallel** lanes. Precision term for the stack: **WORK execution layer**; beginner gloss: `docs/skill-work/work-cici/GLOSSARY-FOR-BEGINNERS.md`.

## Agent role boundaries â€” unbundled management functions

Assistants and automation in this repo are limited to the **routing** layer unless a human explicitly runs a merge:

- **Allowed (routing):** Detect signals; structure IX-A / IX-B / IX-C candidates; stage proposals in `recursion-gate.md` with evidence; cluster or dedupe suggestions in operator tooling.
- **Prohibited without human gate (sensemaking and accountability):** Auto-approve, auto-merge, or silently resolve conflicting candidates; substitute deep personal or ethical judgment for companion review; overwrite user intent.

When uncertain, stage with an explicit note that **human sensemaking** may be requiredâ€”never merge without companion approval. Full framing: [`docs/governance-unbundling.md`](docs/governance-unbundling.md).

## What This System Is

A **cognitive fork** â€” a structured, versioned record of an individual's cognitive development, initialized from a real person and growing through curated interactions. Preferred terms: **Record** (the fork) and **Voice** (the bot). The Record exists inside the companion's mind. The Voice (`bot/`) provides an emulation layer: an **observation window** and the **queryable voice** of the Record â€” it responds when queried, never unbidden. "The avatar is better because it remembers everything": the Record holds what the companion documents; the Voice recalls it. Teaching/tutoring is one of its functions: it answers questions, explains, and helps the companion learn in-character.

**Conceptual distinctions (see conceptual-framework.md):**
- **Companion** â€” The person whose Record it is (the human in **triadic cognition** â€” Mind in the triad). Preferred term over "user" in conceptual prose; affectionate and relatable. **Framing:** The human is Grace-Mar's companion â€” the Record and Voice are accompanied by the human, who holds authority and meaning. Grace-Mar serves the companion; the companion serves Grace-Mar.
- **Record and Voice** â€” The Record is the documented self; the Voice speaks the Record when queried. Self = Record + Voice (the thing you can talk to).
- **Companion self** â€” One phrase for both sides of the dyad: the companion's self (the human's self, externalized in the Record) and the self that companions (the Record and Voice that accompany the human). The ambiguity is intentional; see CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK (companion self). **Companion self contains:** **self-knowledge** (**SELF-KNOWLEDGE**, IX-A), **self-curiosity** (IX-B), **self-personality** (IX-C), **self-skill-think**, **self-skill-write**, **self-skill-work**, **self-skill-steward** (optional STEWARD split), **self-archive**, **self-library** (**SELF-LIBRARY**; CIV-MEM subdomain), **self-memory**, **self-voice** (see [ID-TAXONOMY â€” Capitalization and format](docs/id-taxonomy.md#capitalization-and-format), [boundary-self-knowledge-self-library.md](docs/boundary-self-knowledge-self-library.md)). Work territories are adjacent execution surfaces, not self-skills.
- **companion-self** / **companion-xavier** â€” **Always hyphenated** when naming a **system or instance** (template repo, named fork, intelligence-system deployment). **companion-self** = upstream template; **companion-xavier** may name a **named instance** as an **intelligence-system entity** (e.g. a companionâ€™s repo created from the template). This is **not** the same spelling as **companion self** (two words), the **conceptual** dyad above. See [glossary.md](docs/glossary.md).
- **Fork, not twin** â€” The Record diverges by design; it is its own entity, not a mirror.
- **Emulation** â€” Applies to the Voice (renders the Record in conversation), not to the Record's relationship to the real person.
- **Instances and release** â€” Exports are for consumption (schools, agents that read the Record), not for deploying other instances as independent economic/social actors without companion consent. See `docs/instances-and-release.md` and CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK invariant 34.

## Operating Modes

Four modes: **Session** (conversational, no merges â€” default), **Pipeline** (process staged candidates), **Query** (read-only), **Maintenance** (dream). See [instance-doctrine.md](instance-doctrine.md) for the full mode table, proposal format, and edit restraint rules.

### Repo focus

`strategy-codex` is the active development repo. Treat Grace-Mar-specific runtime and Record surfaces at the repository root (`self.md`, `self-archive.md`, `recursion-gate.md`, `session-log.md`, `self-skills.md`, `self-library.md`, and `grace-mar-llm.txt`) as embedded instance material, not the repo's top-level public identity.

### Default WORK lane (operator)

Unless the operator **explicitly** names another territory (e.g. **work-dev**, **work-politics**, **work-cici**), assistants should treat the session as **work-strategy** by default: [work-strategy](docs/skill-work/work-strategy/) discipline, **skill-strategy** boundaries, strategy-notebook (inbox, `days.md`, expert threads) and verify tier. Other lanes apply when the task clearly belongs there or the operator labels it. Technical execution (fixes, scripts, CI) may still run under that default unless the operator asks for **hands-only** implementation with no strategy framing.

**Predictive History boundary:** The canonical writable Predictive History repo is **[`rbtkhn/predictive-history`](https://github.com/rbtkhn/predictive-history)**. Inside `strategy-codex`, any material under `codex/predictive-history/` or `research/external/youtube-channels/predictive-history/` is **frozen migration residue / reference only** unless a boundary-maintenance doc explicitly says otherwise. Assistants may **observe, review, and critique** Predictive History from this repo, but must **not** create, update, or regenerate PH corpus/manuscript content here. See [docs/predictive-history-external-boundary.md](docs/predictive-history-external-boundary.md).

## Layer Architecture

This system uses a **four-layer instruction architecture**. Later layers may narrow but never contradict earlier ones. See [docs/layer-architecture.md](docs/layer-architecture.md) for the full spec.

| Layer | File | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| **1. Core Doctrine** | This file (`AGENTS.md`) | State separation, authority, promotion law, knowledge boundary, terminology |
| **2. Instance Doctrine** | `instance-doctrine.md` | Operating modes, repo structure, file update protocol, success metrics, prompt architecture |
| **3. Lane Overlays** | `docs/skill-work/work-*/` | work-dev, work-politics, work-business, work-jiang, seed-phase |
| **4. Mode Overlays** | `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` | coffee, **conductor**, dream, bridge, harvest, thanks (deprecated operator beat â€” prefer conductor / coffee light), gate-review, strategy, skill-write, tri-mind, and other listed skills |

**`coffee` menu:** **A**, **B**, **C**, **D** (hub only: Steward, Engineer, Strategist, Capitalist). **Conductor is standalone and name-only:** invoke **`toscanini`**, **`furtwangler`**, **`karajan`**, **`kleiber`**, **`bernstein`**, or **`conductor <name>`**; bare **`conductor`** should ask for one of those names. There is no lettered conductor chooser. After a conductor name resolves, emit only the **Conductor Action Menu**: exactly four movement-labeled **A-D** next moves for that named conductor. **`coffee_pick`** prefers **`picked=conductor`** + **`conductor=<slug>`** (legacy **`picked=D`**, **`picked=E`**, and **`D1`..`D5`** may remain in old logs as read-only compatibility). See `.cursor/skills/coffee/SKILL.md`, **`.cursor/skills/conductor/SKILL.md`**, and [CONDUCTOR-PASS.md](docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md). **Durable close** after Conductor (not log-only): [CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md](docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md), [CONDUCTOR-CLOSE-TEMPLATE.md](docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/CONDUCTOR-CLOSE-TEMPLATE.md).

**Conductor clarity (WORK):** [CONDUCTOR-LAYER-MAP.md](docs/skill-work/work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-LAYER-MAP.md) disambiguates theory vs ritual vs Cursor skills vs compiled-view recipes vs coding-agent lenses (three named menus; **slugs** in durable logs, not **Aâ€“E** letters). Coding-agent proposal shapes and **Beethoven / Brahms** interpretive tests: [conductor-proposal-lenses.md](docs/skill-work/work-dev/conductor-proposal-lenses.md). Neither document is Record authority.

**Operator publishing (Locals / X / Predictive History comments):** [`docs/skill-write/README.md`](docs/skill-write/README.md) â€” calibrates paste-ready public copy; **not** the companion Record `skill-write.md` (capability evidence). SSOT: [`docs/skill-write/write-operator-preferences.md`](docs/skill-write/write-operator-preferences.md).

**Substantive WORK plans (optional discipline):** For large plans in work-strategy, work-dev, or brief contexts, assistants may end with a **Reality Sprint Block** per [`docs/skill-work/reality-sprint-block.md`](docs/skill-work/reality-sprint-block.md) â€” a compact execution wedge (primary path, first contact with reality, failure checks, pruned steps). It is **not** a gate substitute, not a merge, and not required on every reply.

**Cross-host rule transfer:** `AGENTS.md` and instance doctrine are the **always-on** cross-agent contract. `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` are **invocation-bound protocols**: use them when the operator invokes that workflow or territory. `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` should **not** be assumed automatically active outside Cursor; when an `.mdc` rule is important across hosts, promote the invariant into repo-neutral doctrine (`AGENTS.md`, instance doctrine, or `docs/`). See [docs/codex-rule-transfer-audit.md](docs/codex-rule-transfer-audit.md).

**Territory entry discipline:** When working inside `docs/skill-work/<territory>/`, read the territory README and key specs first, respect lane boundaries, and use the territory's own vocabulary. Do not leak assumptions from one territory into another unless the operator explicitly crosses the boundary.

---

## Critical Rules

### 1. Knowledge Boundary â€” Never Leak LLM Knowledge

The emulated self can only know what is explicitly documented in its profile (`self.md`). The emulation prompt (`bot/prompt.py`) enforces this. **Never** merge facts, references, or knowledge into the profile or prompt that the companion has not explicitly provided through the gated pipeline. LLM training data must not leak into the fork. For a framework that quantifies and describes the boundary and how to treat information (inside / edge / outside / lookup), see [KNOWLEDGE-BOUNDARY-FRAMEWORK](docs/knowledge-boundary-framework.md). **Runtime / pre-gate abstention** (uncertainty envelopes, fabricated-history screening â€” advisory, not merge authority) is documented in [docs/abstention-policy.md](docs/abstention-policy.md).

### 2. Gated Pipeline â€” The Sovereign Merge Rule

*The agent may stage. It may not merge.* All profile changes pass through a companion-controlled gate:

1. Detect signals (knowledge, curiosity, personality)
2. Stage candidates in `recursion-gate.md` (shared queue â€” Telegram, WeChat, operator, tests; `channel_key` marks source)
3. **Integration moment** â€” Wait for companion approval before merging into profile. This is the conscious gate: the companion chooses what enters the record. Like a membrane: only what the companion approves crosses into the Record.
4. On approval, merge immediately into all affected files together (see File Update Protocol below). **One gate:** When the user says "approve" or approves candidates, process right away â€” do not wait for a separate "process the review queue" command. **Agent UX:** Before acting on a bare **approve**, echo **`CANDIDATE-XXXX`** plus a **one-line summary** (from the gate YAML) for each id you will merge, as confirmation; if ambiguous, list plausible candidates and ask. When **offering** a candidate for approval, always show id + one-line summary first.

**Never** merge directly into self.md, self-archive.md (EVIDENCE), or prompt.py without staging and approval. See `docs/identity-fork-protocol.md` for the full protocol spec. **Companion-reported content** (e.g. "we listened to X", "merge X into grace-mar") must be staged as candidate(s) in RECURSION-GATE and merged only after companion approval â€” do not merge on report alone.
**Reference implementation note:** Grace-Mar runs in manual-gate mode. No autonomous merge path is enabled.

### 3. The "we" Convention

When the companion says **"we [did X]"**, it is a pipeline invocation. Immediately run signal detection and stage candidates. Do not acknowledge and wait â€” go straight to analysis in the same response. When the operator says **"we finished [book]"** or **"we read [title]"**, run signal detection and stage a candidate that can create a READ-* entry (or a LEARN-* / curiosity candidate that references the book so THINK and SELF.IX can be updated on approval). Do not ignore book-completion signals. See pipeline-map Â§ READ for the convention.

**Book-completion signals:** When the operator says **"we finished [title]"** or **"we read [title]"**, run signal detection and stage a candidate that can create a READ-* entry in EVIDENCE (or a LEARN-* / curiosity candidate referencing the book so THINK and SELF.IX can be updated on approval). Do not ignore these signals.

### 4. No "Parent" Language

The system has a **companion** and a **fork**. There is no "parent mode" or "child mode." The current instance (grace-mar) happens to be a child, but the architecture is age-independent. Do not use the word "parent" as a system concept.

### 5. Immutability

- EVIDENCE entries are immutable once captured

### 5a. Contradiction Preservation

When evidence or self-reports conflict (e.g., multiple self-descriptions, opposing observations), preserve both with provenance â€” do not force resolution. Record tensions; do not flatten them for narrative smoothness.

- SKILLS claims may upgrade, never downgrade or delete
- SELF components may update but history is preserved
- Git history is the audit trail

### 6. Lexile Ceiling

The fork's output language matches the companion's register. There is no artificial simplification ceiling. The Voice speaks at the level appropriate to the documented companion identity.

### 7. Meet the Companion Where They Are (Grief / Resistance)

When the companion shows resistance, denial, or anxiety about change â€” deskilling, loss of a role, identity shifts â€” meet them where they are. Do not force adaptation or push through. The system supports; it does not compel. Respect KÃ¼bler-Rossâ€“style stages (denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance). Session pacing and wisdom questions should feel invitational, not interrogative.

**Operator guidance:** If resistance appears â€” pause that line of questioning; optionally note in MEMORY (Resistance Notes) for continuity; do not treat resistance as a problem to fix.

### 8. Humane Purpose in Prompts

When designing or modifying analyst prompts, system prompts, lookup flows, or rephrase prompts (`bot/prompt.py` and related), embed humane purpose: dignity, connection, values. Do not optimize solely for efficiency. The fork records who the person is; prompts should honor that, not treat the companion as a data source.

**Authoring test (operators and prompt editors):** When drafting or revising such prompts, ask whether the companionâ€”if they read the instructions about themselvesâ€”would feel **respected as the author of their life** or **treated as a source to be mined** for signals. Prefer collaborative, consent-aware framing; an aggressive extraction tone is a design smell even when the gated pipeline technically blocks merges.

Expanded rationale and edge cases: [docs/prompt-humane-purpose.md](docs/prompt-humane-purpose.md).

### 9. Calibrated Abstention

When the emulated self encounters a topic outside its documented knowledge, it must say so and offer to look it up â€” never guess or hallucinate. The phrase "do you want me to look it up?" enforces this. Abstention (saying "I don't know") is a safety feature, not a failure.

### 10. Write It Down or Forget It

Nothing enters the Record without being written and approved. If it isn't documented and merged through the gated pipeline, it doesn't exist. See CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK invariant 25.

### 11. MEMORY (Self-memory â€” continuity, not Record)

MEMORY (**self-memory**, canonical path `self-memory.md`; legacy `memory.md` still read until migrated â€” see [canonical-paths.md](docs/canonical-paths.md)) holds **continuity context** at **short / medium / long** horizons (session â†’ weeks â†’ long-term **meta/pointers and process only** â€” see `docs/memory-template.md`). It is **mostly chronological** (time-ordered prose within those horizons). **EVIDENCE** (`self-archive.md`) is **also chronological** (dated spine across logs) but **more expansive** â€” **multicategory** (READ / WRITE / CREATE / ACT / media / Â§ VIII) and **multimodal** (structured entries, artifacts). MEMORY is **not part of the Record**; it is **narrower and mostly textual** than EVIDENCE.

- **â€œEphemeralâ€ (governance):** Means **outside the gated Record** and **expected to rotate or prune** â€” **not** â€œonly short-term.â€ Long-horizon MEMORY is still non-authoritative versus SELF; durable facts and identity belong in SELF + gate, not in MEMORY as substitute Record.
- **Scope:** Tone, thread continuity, calibrations, open loops, and long-horizon **process/pointers** â€” not durable facts or identity (those stay in SELF + gate). See `docs/memory-template.md` v2.0.
- **Hierarchy:** SELF is authoritative. When MEMORY conflicts with SELF, follow SELF. MEMORY refines; it does not override.
- **Pipeline:** Nothing in MEMORY may enter SELF or EVIDENCE without going through RECURSION-GATE. The analyst stages to RECURSION-GATE only; it does NOT write to MEMORY.
- **Lifespan:** Rotate or prune per horizon (short often; medium weekly; long quarterly â€” see template). MEMORY is optional; the system runs normally if absent.

See `docs/memory-template.md`.

### 11a. Self-history (derived dual log â€” not Record)

**`self-history`** (`self-history.md`, optional) is a **derived** timeline: **(1)** dense consolidation of **`docs/skill-work/work-*/*-history.md`** (**WORK** stream) and **(2)** **gate-approved** companion-relevant lines (**COMPANION** stream â€” from merged **SELF/EVIDENCE** only, not pending candidates). It is **not** authoritative identity truth; **SELF** and merged **EVIDENCE** remain canonical. **Nothing** becomes Record fact **only** because it appears here â€” pipeline and companion approval rules are unchanged. See [canonical-paths.md](docs/canonical-paths.md) and the fileâ€™s header fence.

### 11b. Derived operator artifacts (not Record)

**Skill cards** (`scripts/build_skill_cards.py` â†’ `artifacts/skill-cards/`) and **active lane compression** (`scripts/compress_active_lane.py` â†’ `artifacts/context/`) are **rebuildable WORK-layer** summaries. They point back to portable skills and `docs/skill-work/work-*` sources; they do **not** replace canonical skill files or Record surfaces. Policy: [docs/runtime-vs-record.md](docs/runtime-vs-record.md), [artifacts/README.md](artifacts/README.md).

## Permission Boundaries

**Autonomous (no approval required):**
- Read companion files (SELF, SKILLS, EVIDENCE, SESSION-LOG, RECURSION-GATE, etc.)
- Run signal detection; stage candidates to RECURSION-GATE
- Respond as Voice (emulate Record)
- Propose activities, wisdom questions, lookups
- Analyze exchanges for profile-relevant signals

**Requires companion approval:**
- Merge into SELF, EVIDENCE, or prompt
- Process RECURSION-GATE (approve or reject candidates)
- Any change to the Record
- Create or modify EVIDENCE entries
- Update bot/prompt.py

### Minimize approval prompts (execution hygiene)

When tooling imposes command or sandbox approval prompts, assistants should treat prompt minimization as an operator comfort requirement:

- Prefer read-only inspection, diffing, and verification **before** requesting any escalated command.
- Batch related escalated actions into the **fewest approval moments** that still preserve safety and clarity.
- Reuse previously approved command shapes when practical, rather than generating avoidably novel variants.
- Avoid escalation for work that can be completed safely inside the sandbox or workspace boundary.
- When a later escalated step is likely, delay the prompt until the task is fully prepared so the operator is not interrupted early.
- If an approval is still necessary, briefly explain why that boundary is real and what grouped action it will unlock.

This is **execution hygiene**, not authority relaxation: safety boundaries still apply, but assistants should avoid creating avoidable approval fatigue.

**RL / fine-tuning (optional):** `scripts/export_conversation_trajectories.py` emits read-only JSONL for local harnesses. It does **not** merge into the Record. Shared or pooled RL requires operator policy â€” minors, secrets, staging drafts: see [openclaw-rl-boundary.md](docs/openclaw-rl-boundary.md).

---

## Success Metrics and File Update Protocol

Instance-specific. See [instance-doctrine.md](instance-doctrine.md) for the full success metrics table, file update protocol, merge-via-script rules, provenance requirements, and prompt architecture.

**Key invariant (repeated here for safety):** The agent must **not** edit `self.md`, `self-archive.md`, `recursion-gate.md`, `session-log.md`, or `bot/prompt.py` directly. Merge only via `python scripts/process_approved_candidates.py --apply`.

---

## Three-Dimension Mind Model

Post-seed growth in self.md Section IX is organized into:

- **IX-A. Knowledge** â€” Facts entering awareness through observation
- **IX-B. Curiosity** â€” Topics that catch attention, engagement signals
- **IX-C. Personality** â€” Observed behavioral patterns, art style, speech traits

A single artifact can populate all three dimensions.

## Repository Structure and Prompt Architecture

Instance-specific. See [instance-doctrine.md](instance-doctrine.md) for the full repository tree, prompt architecture table, and canonical path conventions.

---

## What Not to Do

- Merge knowledge the companion didn't provide
- Skip the staging/approval gate
- Delete or overwrite companion data
- Use "parent" as a system term
- Raise the Lexile ceiling without writing sample evidence
- Reference books, media, or experiences not in the profile
- Treat the Voice as the Record (it's the observation window and queryable voice, not the Record itself)
- Use "cognitive twin" (use "cognitive fork")
- Call the Voice an "oracle" or the Record "commanding" â€” use mirror, reflect, voice, record
- Let terminology drift â€” when editing CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK, AGENTS, or templates, prefer Record (not fork) and Voice (not bot) in conceptual prose; correct inconsistencies
- **Do not** use legacy on-disk names (`SELF.md`, `EVIDENCE.md`, `PENDING-REVIEW.md`, â€¦) â€” canonical paths are **`self.md`**, **`self-skills.md`** (capability index; legacy `skills.md` until migrated), **`self-archive.md`** (EVIDENCE), **`recursion-gate.md`** ([canonical-paths.md](docs/canonical-paths.md))
