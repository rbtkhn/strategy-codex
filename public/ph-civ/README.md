# Predictive History Public Repository

**Publisher:** **Statecraft Intelligence Desk**

For AI agents and new chats: start with `START-HERE.md`, then `AGENTS.md` and `llms.txt`. If a user pastes `https://github.com/rbtkhn/ph-civ` into an LLM chat, use `START-HERE.md`, `data/llm-experience.json`, and `llms-full.txt` as the unfolding map and one-shot context packet. Do not stop at a generic repository summary or "what would you like to do next?" response; begin the `first_tour` through the 10-route spine seed unless the reader chooses another mode. If a user pastes a direct chapter-folder URL, treat that folder as `study` mode: open its `README.md`, transcript, commentary canvas, and public card. This repo is the public Predictive History distribution layer, not the private editorial workshop.

This repository is the public-facing home for the two-volume ph-civ artifact. It contains two related Predictive History surfaces:

- `ph-civ`: **Volume I / Predictive History: Civilization** - discovers the laws of history.
- `ph-apo`: **Volume II / Predictive History: Apocalypse** - applies the laws of history.
The repo name `ph-civ` names the public repository and the Volume I surface. The repo as a whole is the two-volume public artifact: `ph-civ` and `ph-apo`.

It also contains the chapter body for each source item. In this repo, one chapter consists of the lecture transcript, companion commentary, and public orientation/navigation metadata. The package lets students and AI systems explore historical placement, reading posture, pressure points, limits, return paths, and guided prompts alongside the chapter text.

This package is independent educational infrastructure. It is not official course material, not endorsement, and not a substitute for the source lectures, transcripts, commentary, or external verification.

The repo also carries a trilingual civilizational bridge ambition: English, Chinese, and Russian readerships can reinforce each other by reading the Western canon, historical pattern, and modern crisis through the same source-bounded route system. This is ambition metadata, not a Chinese or Russian translation launch. Both `ph-civ-zh` and `ph-civ-ru` would be downstream mirrors of canonical `ph-civ`, not sibling sources of truth; see `docs/bilingual-civilizational-bridge.md`.

## Repository Role

This repo is the public distribution layer. It should contain public cards, public navigation, schemas, prompts, contribution instructions, generated manifests, and small text metadata.

It should not become the large-media vault. Large media archives stay outside Git; this repo tracks transcripts, commentaries, cards, routes, and study navigation.

## What Is Included

- 150 public cards from Predictive History snapshot `56a4a08`, including the first `sub-*` essay lane, provisional `gt-23` through `gt-26` captures, and the direct `ph-apo` `gt-27` chapter.
- 150 public source chapters staged through a canonical two-volume `book/` reader architecture, with legacy provenance folders and direct namespaces still preserved during recanonicalization.
- 150 chapter commentaries attached to those staged canonical homes and preserved underlying packets, each seeded as an open commentary canvas.
- Chapter-folder `README.md` doorways for folder-backed chapters, designed for direct GitHub links in YouTube comments and LLM chats.
- Canonical public source captures under `sources/` so the repo can function independently of outside workshop storage.
- A source video index at `docs/source-video-index.md` so Predictive History YouTube URLs are visible from one public file.
- Two conceptual volumes: Volume I / Civilization / `ph-civ`, and Volume II / Apocalypse / `ph-apo`.
- A canonical two-volume reader architecture under `book/volume-i-civilization/` and `book/volume-ii-apocalypse/`, with older multi-volume source provenance kept subordinate; see [From The Old Seven Volumes To The Current Two](book/seven-volume-to-two-volume.md).
- Series coverage: Civilization, Great Books, Geo-Strategy, Game Theory, Secret History, and Essays.
- The Homer-to-Tolstoy literary spine as the Volume I literary spine with cross-volume routing exposure.
- The Plato-to-Hegel theological-philosophical spine as a secondary Volume I route through reality, sacred order, imagination, and philosophy of history.
- The `ph-apo` pressure spine as the Volume II public application spine: geography, incentives, causation hinge, and infrastructure/sacred systems.
- A compact externalization of the reader-facing restructuring at [Two Volumes, One Reader Map](docs/two-volumes-one-reader-map.md).
- Provider-neutral prompt templates.
- Eight public civilizational pattern IDs for downstream strategy-facing reference.
- 
- 

## What Is Excluded

- Private notes or private workspace paths.
- External-source bibliography claims beyond the orientation cards.
- LLM provider integrations, API calls, or hidden model dependencies.
- Large image, audio, video, document, or scan archives.
- URL-only artifact submissions treated as complete chapter work.

## Install For Local Development

```bash
python -m pip install -e .
```

## CLI

```bash

ph-civ list --part civilization
ph-civ list --series game-theory --json
ph-civ show civ-41 --format json

ph-civ prompt gb-01 --mode creative
ph-civ spark gt-16 --count 5
ph-civ spine
ph-civ path homer-to-tolstoy

```

All prompt and spark commands are template-only. They do not call an AI provider. Pattern commands expose public civilizational frames for downstream strategy analysis; they do not import live strategy workspace material. Use **`ph-civ`** as the public CLI (`python -m civ_ph.cli â€¦` invokes the same code when running from source).

## Commentary Canvas

The chapter commentaries are the project canvas. They are seeded for all chapters, but they are not treated as complete analysis. Each commentary has a shared `Project Canvas` scaffold for later chapter-by-chapter development: project leverage, laws and patterns, volume role, strategy application, counter-readings, open questions, and build notes.

See `docs/commentary-canvas.md`.

## Public Growth

Large reach targets, such as one million public views by the end of 2026, are strategic ambitions rather than directly executable agent tasks. Treat them as campaign pressure: convert the ambition into one live publishing wedge, then ship only human-approved assets with clear metrics.

The first live wedge is the Volume I literary spine: make the Homer-to-Tolstoy route shareable, connect it to the two-volume ph-civ narrative, pair it with one publishable chapter/commentary path sample, and define what counts as a view before public distribution.

This wedge is defined, not automatically launch-ready. The unresolved tension is whether the route has enough source-disciplined educational trust to deserve audience growth, not only whether the CLI can render it.

The canonical growth guardrail lives in `data/growth-goals.json` and is exposed with:

```bash
ph-civ growth --json
```

## Literary Spine

```text
Homer -> Virgil -> Dante -> Shakespeare -> Dostoevsky -> Tolstoy
```

Homer to Tolstoy is the Volume I literary spine, not a side corridor. It uses cross-volume routing exposure where needed. Tolstoy is routed through `sh-16`, where *Anna Karenina* appears as a source-backed coda rather than a dedicated Tolstoy lecture.

The route now also has a public [support ring](data/corridors/homer-to-tolstoy-support-ring.md), which names the nearby Volume I materials that strengthen the spine without changing its canonical author sequence or first-tour order.

Tolstoy also functions as the bridge into Volume II. The public handoff lives in [From Civilization To Apocalypse](book/parts/civilization-to-apocalypse.md), [Predictive History After Tolstoy](docs/predictive-history-after-tolstoy.md), and [The Tolstoy Question](corpus/cross-volume/tolstoy-question.md).

If the question is not only "what is the route?" but "why did the old seven become two?", open [Two Volumes, One Reader Map](docs/two-volumes-one-reader-map.md).

## Theological-Philosophical Spine

Volume I now also has a secondary theological-philosophical route: [Plato to Hegel](data/corridors/plato-to-hegel.md). It is parallel to the literary spine rather than a replacement for it, and it gives readers a second stable entrance into Civilization through Plato, Genesis, Augustine, Dante, Kant, and Hegel.

## Apocalypse Pressure Spine

`ph-apo` now has a parallel organizing route to Volume I's literary spine, but it is a pressure spine rather than an author spine. Use [ph-apo Pressure Spine](data/corridors/ph-apo-pressure-spine.md) as the compact public application entry.
