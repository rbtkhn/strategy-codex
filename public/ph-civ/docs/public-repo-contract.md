# Public Repository Contract

This repository is the public-facing distribution layer for the two-volume ph-civ artifact: `ph-civ`, `ph-apo`, and `ph-mus`.

If a reader pastes the GitHub URL into an LLM chat, the repo should unfold from `START-HERE.md` and `data/llm-experience.json`. Those files define the provider-neutral first-tour flow, reader modes, 10-route spine seed, and guardrails for using public transcripts, commentaries, routes, patterns, and museum manifests.

## Public Surfaces

- `ph-civ`: **Volume I / Predictive History: Civilization** public orientation cards, paths, prompts, and study navigation for discovering the laws of history.
- `ph-apo`: **Volume II / Predictive History: Apocalypse** public orientation cards, paths, prompts, and study navigation for applying the laws of history.
- `ph-mus`: **Predictive History Museum** public exhibit manifests, artifact metadata, schemas, validation rules, and generated reader-facing exhibit pages for both volumes.

`ph-mus` is not a third volume. It is the chapter exhibit layer corresponding to chapters across Volume I and Volume II.

## Source Of Truth Boundary

This repo publishes public-facing material, including chapter transcripts, chapter commentaries, public cards, routes, prompts, schemas, and manifests. It is not a private notes workspace and not the large artifact archive.

Canonical public source captures should also live inside this repository under a repo-local `sources/` tree so `ph-civ` remains independently usable without any outside workshop storage. Those source captures should preserve the full lecture transcript body inside the repo, even when direct chapter packets are rendered as lighter public study doorways.

The current chapter corpus was imported from the maintained Predictive History workspace and keeps that snapshot as provenance. Physical source series and folder labels are provenance metadata; the public reader architecture is the two-volume ph-civ rollup.

Legacy `book/volume-*` paths may remain as migration residue and provenance, but they are not the preferred growth contract for new public chapter work. New Civilization-facing chapter growth should land directly under `ph-civ/chapters/`, and new Apocalypse-facing chapter growth should land directly under `ph-apo/chapters/`.

Each public chapter consists of:

- lecture transcript
- companion commentary as an open project canvas
- public orientation/navigation metadata

Commentaries are not presumed complete at seed time. Each commentary must carry the shared Project Canvas scaffold so the chapter can be enhanced one by one without losing its role in the larger ph-civ project.

## Public Growth Goals

Public reach goals belong in this repository only as strategy-facing ambitions and planning metadata. They are not proof that attention has been earned, and they are not directly completable by an agent.

When a public-growth ambition is stated, convert it into measurable project machinery:

- repo narrative and first-screen clarity
- shareable volume, chapter, spine, route, and museum surfaces
- transcript/commentary/card readiness
- ph-mus exhibit readiness
- analytics definitions and view-count boundaries
- distribution calendar and weekly review loop
- launch copy or assets staged for human approval

The canonical growth guardrail is `data/growth-goals.json`.

Defined public-growth machinery is not the same as launch readiness. A route is launch-ready only when it can serve a first public reader without relying on private context, unsupported scholarly claims, or metric pressure to supply meaning.

## Museum Storage Boundary

Museum artifacts must not be represented by URLs alone.

Every accepted museum artifact needs:

- a local file in the museum vault
- a mirrored file in the shared document cloud workspace
- provenance URL or citation
- rights status
- exhibit and room assignment
- curator note
- limit or caution

Git should track manifests, metadata, schemas, small generated pages, and validation rules. Git should not be used as the primary storage system for large image, audio, video, PDF, scan, or derivative archives.

## Chapter Exhibit Model

The primary museum unit is the chapter exhibit.

Each exhibit should map to one chapter in `ph-civ` or `ph-apo`. Every chapter should eventually have a corresponding `ph-mus` exhibit. A useful exhibit contains a small curated set of artifacts arranged into rooms:

- `entrance_artifact`
- `context_room`
- `primary_artifacts_and_texts`
- `comparison_artifacts`
- `pressure_systems`
- `caution_room`

Flat item inventories may be useful as imports or review exports, but they are not the museum source of truth.

The current public choreography export is `data/routes/choreography.json`; the public museum exhibit index is `data/museum/index.json`. These files expose only safe routing metadata and manifest pointers, not artifact binaries.

The LLM-native unfolding map is `data/llm-experience.json`; it must stay aligned with `data/routes/seed.json`, `data/cards.jsonl`, `data/patterns.json`, and `data/routes/choreography.json`.

## Human Curator Role

Human curators provide judgment that cannot be automated away: selection taste, cultural and historical balance, rights prudence, emotional calibration, representative caution, and final responsibility for why an artifact belongs in a chapter exhibit.
