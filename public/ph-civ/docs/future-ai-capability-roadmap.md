# Future AI Capability Roadmap

`ph-civ`, `ph-apo`, and `ph-mus` should be treated not merely as static exports, but as future-facing public context layers that become more useful as AI interfaces mature.

## Likely Capability Unlocks

1. **Native context-pack import**
   AI systems may increasingly support structured project memory, MCP resources, knowledge packs, or app connectors. `ph-civ`, `ph-apo`, and `ph-mus` should remain easy to ingest as JSONL, Markdown, schema-valid cards, exhibit manifests, and eventually MCP resources.

2. **Promptless study flows**
   Users should not need to know the right question in advance. Commands like `ph-civ start`, `ph-civ spark`, `ph-civ path`, and `ph-civ today` should generate first questions, guided sessions, and next steps automatically.

3. **Agentic reading companions**
   AI agents will be able to walk a user through a path over multiple sessions: resume Homer to Tolstoy, quiz a lecture, compare a chapter to another, or continue a study thread from prior context. This requires stable IDs, paths, review status, and typed relations.

4. **Multimodal context**
   Museum exhibits can become a major asset as AI systems accept images, maps, objects, timelines, music, documents, and screenshots as first-class context. The exhibit schema should stay rights-aware, storage-explicit, and machine-readable.

5. **Voice and tutor personalization**
   The same card should eventually render as seminar tutor, skeptical counter-reader, exam prep, creative prompt, or introductory guide. This argues for structured payloads and modular prompt templates.

6. **Citation and provenance enforcement**
   AI systems will likely improve at source-bounded answers. `ph-civ`, `ph-apo`, and `ph-mus` should preserve clear boundaries between orientation cards, transcripts, commentary, artifact metadata, and quote-grade claims.

7. **Graph navigation**
   Cross-volume corridors may become a core feature: not only searching for a card, but following routes such as Homer to Dante to Dostoevsky, Rome's afterlives, or pressure corridors in World War. Typed edges should remain stable and parseable.

8. **Local/offline AI**
   As local models improve, the public surfaces should work well as small portable packages that can be installed once and used by local agents without dependence on any single AI provider.

9. **Community contribution workflows**
   Human curators can contribute museum exhibits, artifact metadata, prompt improvements, path refinements, and guardrail notes. Schemas and validators should make contribution review straightforward.

10. **Adaptive learning metrics**
    Later versions may track which cards confuse users, which paths are most used, where sparks fail, and what questions people ask. These metrics can improve the context layer without altering source materials.

## Design Principle

Structured context now, richer interfaces later.

Future work should bias toward stable IDs, plain JSON/JSONL, schema validation, Markdown readability, MCP readiness, promptless commands, museum-manifest compatibility, no source-text leakage, strong provenance boundaries, and first-good-question generation as a core user experience.
