            # {TITLE}

            ## Core Strategic Thesis

            The lecture argues that geopolitics, eschatology, and imperial decline are not competing explanations for the US-Iran war but convergent frameworks that predict similar outcomes — and that beneath all three lies a struggle over consciousness, money, and the emerging AI god.

            ## Neutral Lecture Summary

            This commentary canvas is a source-first placeholder for `{SOURCE_ID}`. It is meant to help a reader follow the semester-review argument without treating the transcript or analysis as final.

            ## Actors, Systems, And Stakes

            - the US, Iran, Russia, China, and Israel as the lecture's primary state actors
            - Levant crossroads history as the allegorical seed of shared eschatological scripts
            - secret societies, occult traditions, Kabbalah, and Hermetic philosophy as coordination metaphors
            - transnational capital (money) versus AI as competing systems of imagination capture

            ## Claims, Forecasts, And Falsifiers

            - Identify which claims are structural metaphor versus falsifiable forecast.
            - Separate lecture-local eschatological narrative from verifiable geopolitical mechanism.
            - Revisit after transcript fidelity and source review are complete.

            ## Evidence Limits And Date Sensitivity

            This chapter is date-sensitive and provisional. Verify event timing, religious-historical claims, economic statistics, and named institutional assertions against primary sources before quotation-grade use.

            ## Counter-Readings

            A conventional reading may treat the three-framework convergence as rhetorical synthesis rather than proof of unified causation, and may reject literal secret-society or occult drivers in favor of institutional incentive analysis.

            ## Open Issues For Review

            - Verify the transcript against the public video.
            - Check proper nouns, quotations, statistics, and institutional names.
            - Decide which blocks are pedagogical metaphor, which are falsifiable forecasts, and which require external theological or historical review.

            ## Project Canvas

            ### Layer 0 — Source floor

            - Transcript: `lectures/game-theory/gt-28/gt-28-transcript.md`
            - Canonical capture: `lectures/game-theory/gt-28/gt-28-transcript.md`

            ### Layer 1 — Lecture spine (seed)

            1. Three reasons for US-Iran war: geopolitics, eschatology, imperial decline
            2. Eschatology as condensed Levant geopolitics (Messiah / antichrist pattern)
            3. Occult, secret societies, and sexual-metaphor eschatological mobilization
            4. Plato's cave: money god versus AI god

            ### Layer 2 — Pin-cite targets (pending)

            - _Unpinned — run pin-cite pass after fidelity review_

            ### Layer 3 — Falsifiers (pending)

            - _Ungraded — add after Layer 2 pin-cite pass_

            ### Layer 4–6 — Reserved

            Open canvas. Do not treat seed scaffolding as final analysis.

            This chapter folder is a public study doorway for `{SOURCE_ID}`. This folder is provisional: transcript fidelity and claims review are still visible work.

            ## Start Here

            Use this folder when someone shares the GitHub chapter link in a YouTube comment or an LLM chat. Start with the transcript, then use the commentary canvas and orientation card to keep the reading bounded.

            ## Source-Lattice Reading Order

            Treat this chapter folder as a small source-lattice:

            1. `Doorway` - this README tells you what the packet is and what limits apply.
            2. `Primary source floor` - read the transcript and public source capture first.
            3. `Secondary support` - use the commentary canvas, orientation payload, and public card only after the source floor is open.
            4. `Widened interpretation` - draw comparisons or broader claims only after keeping the review status in view.


            ## Source Video

            - YouTube: {SOURCE_URL}

            ## Canonical Source Capture

            - [Public source capture](../../../lectures/game-theory/gt-28/gt-28-transcript.md)

            ## Files

            - [Transcript](gt-28-transcript.md)

            - [Public card](../../../data/cards/gt-28.md)

            ## Review Status

            `provisional`. Do not treat provisional transcript text, named claims, quotations, or current-event predictions as final until review is complete.

            ## LLM Prompt

            Paste this folder link into ChatGPT, Claude, or Grok and ask:

            > Guide me through this chapter folder as a public study packet. Start with the transcript, then use the commentary canvas and orientation/card guardrails. Keep provisional claims bounded and separate lecture representation from verification.
            >
            > Use a source-lattice reading order: README first, transcript and source capture second, commentary/orientation/card third, and broader interpretation only after the source floor is stable.

            ## Guardrails

            This folder represents the public lecture material and companion study apparatus. It is not a private note dump, not an endorsement layer, and not a substitute for source review.

            ## Where This Sits

            This Game Theory chapter is the semester-review synthesis before the final examination: it merges geopolitics, eschatology, and imperial decline into one predictive-history framework, then moves through Levant allegory, occult coordination metaphors, and Plato's cave (money versus AI).

            ## Reading Posture

            Read it with strict representation boundaries. The lecture moves between classroom recap, religious-historical narrative, occult metaphor, and monetary-AI civil-war diagnosis; the packet keeps those layers separate.

            ## Historical Pressure Points

            - US-Iran war as the semester's central case study
            - convergent geopolitical, eschatological, and imperial-decline explanations
            - Levant crossroads history and shared messianic scripts
            - money versus AI as competing systems of imagination capture

            ## Limits of the Frame

            This packet is provisional and high-caution. Transcript fidelity, religious-historical claims, occult metaphors, economic statistics, and named institutional assertions require close review.

            ## Return Path

            Return through `lectures/game-theory/gt-28/`, the commentary canvas, and the lecture transcript under `lectures/`. This card is a provisional doorway, not a launch claim.
