# Commentary Canvas

> **Superseded for rebuild work:** [commentary-methodology-v2.md](commentary-methodology-v2.md) (chapter-only L0–6; Parts deprecated). Surface readiness vocabulary: [public-surface-status.md](public-surface-status.md). This file documents the retired v1 hybrid Part pilot only.

Commentaries are working surfaces for enhancing and leveraging ph-civ. A seeded commentary is not finished analysis. It is a protected surface for later synthesis.

## Hybrid model (Volume I Parts pilot)

**Chapter commentary (thin receipt)** — one per chapter folder:

- Layer 0–2: metadata, neutral summary, transcript pin-cites
- `## Part apparatus` pointer to the parent Part commentary and bibliography
- Minimal `Project Canvas (chapter-local)` — open questions only

**Part commentary (thick synthesis)** — one per Volume I Part (pilot: Part II + Part III + Part IV + Part V):

- Cross-chapter prediction ledger, Hellenic grammar, corridor placement
- Great Books sections (`### gb-NN`) when woven into the Part
- External counter-readings; links to Part bibliography

**Part bibliography** — sibling markdown (`part-NN-{slug}-bibliography.md`):

- External primary/secondary sources only; every entry tagged `supports: civ-NN` and/or `gb-NN`
- Chapter commentaries link here; do not duplicate bib blocks per chapter

Naming law: see `docs/routes/volume-i-parts/README.md`.

## Chapter commentary (thin)

Every chapter commentary should preserve:

- the lecture transcript as the source body, without rewriting it
- Layer 0–2 source-backed notes with line references
- open canvas metadata in frontmatter
- a Part apparatus pointer when the chapter belongs to a Part with apparatus files

Required frontmatter (chapter):

- `commentary_status`
- `canvas_status: open`
- `analysis_depth: seed` (or `layer2_drafted` when Layer 2 is populated)
- `scaffold_version: ph_civ_commentary_canvas_v1`

Optional when Part apparatus exists:

- `part_id`, `part_commentary_path`, `part_bibliography_path` on transcript or commentary

Cross-chapter predictions, external counter-readings, and bibliography belong in **Part** files, not duplicated in chapter commentaries.

## Part commentary (thick)

Required frontmatter (Part):

- `part_id`, `part_number`, `volume: I`
- `commentary_status`, `canvas_status: open`
- `scaffold_version: ph_civ_part_commentary_v1`
- `doorway_path`, `bibliography_path`

Part Project Canvas sections mirror the chapter canvas at Part grain (leverage, patterns, strategy, open questions).

The scaffold is intentionally permissive. It should invite development without implying that commentary is complete.

## Great Books stub routing (Volume V)

When a Great Books episode is woven into a Volume I Part, the **canonical** thick commentary lives in the Part file (`### gb-NN` section). The volume-v `gb-NN-commentary.md` becomes a **stub**:

- `analysis_depth: stub_routed_to_part`
- `part_commentary_path` + `part_bibliography_path` in frontmatter
- Body: core thesis one-liner, read order, Part placement — no duplicate prediction tables

**Pilot stubs:** Part II — `gb-02`, `gb-03`, `gb-05`, `gb-07`; Part III — `gb-08`.

Transcript frontmatter should carry `part_id` and Part apparatus paths when the GB belongs to a Part with hybrid files.

## Secret History companion pointer (Part IV)

Part IV has no Great Books weave. The `sh-17` companion @ `civ-22` uses a **Part commentary pointer** (`### sh-17`) — same routing law as GB stub-to-Part, but the SH packet body stays in `volume-vi/sh-17/`. Chapter `civ-22` README links the pointer; do not merge SH body into Part or civ commentary.

**Pilot example:** [Part IV commentary § civ-22](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-04-ancient-foundations-commentary.md#civ-22) + [§ sh-17](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-04-ancient-foundations-commentary.md#sh-17); thin chapter: [civ-22-commentary](../lectures/civilization/civ-22/civ-22-commentary.md).

## Secret History companion pointer (Part V)

Part V has no Great Books weave. The `sh-18` companion @ `civ-28` uses a **Part commentary pointer** (`### sh-18`) — same routing law as Part IV `sh-17`: SH packet body stays in `volume-vi/sh-18/` and `secret-history-support/sh-18/`. Chapter `civ-28` README links Part apparatus first; do not merge SH body into Part or civ commentary.

**Pilot example:** [Part V commentary § civ-28](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-05-christianity-and-islam-commentary.md#civ-28) + [§ sh-18](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-05-christianity-and-islam-commentary.md#sh-18); thin chapter: [civ-28-commentary](../lectures/civilization/civ-28/civ-28-commentary.md).

## Great Books weave pointer (Part VI)

Part VI carries the Dante GB weave (`gb-09`–`gb-12`). Volume-v chapter commentary stubs route to Part apparatus — same law as Part II `gb-02`.

**Pilot example:** [Part VI commentary § civ-29](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-06-medieval-imagination-commentary.md#civ-29) + [§ gb-12](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-06-medieval-imagination-commentary.md#gb-12); thin chapter: [civ-29-commentary](../lectures/civilization/civ-29/civ-29-commentary.md); GB stub: [gb-12-commentary](../lectures/great-books/gb-12/gb-12-commentary.md).

## Part apparatus pointer (Part VII wedge)

Part VII hybrid pilot starts with the **`civ-40` bridge + `civ-41` close** wedge (`gb-10` close pointer). Volume-ii chapter READMEs for wedge chapters link Part apparatus; deferred `civ-35`–`39` sections remain stub headers until pin-cite + slim pass.

**Pilot example:** [Part VII commentary § civ-40](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-07-world-after-rome-commentary.md#civ-40) + [§ civ-41](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-07-world-after-rome-commentary.md#civ-41) + [§ gb-10 (close)](../docs/routes/volume-i-parts/part-07-world-after-rome-commentary.md#gb-10); thin chapters: [civ-40-commentary](../lectures/civilization/civ-40/civ-40-commentary.md), [civ-41-commentary](../lectures/civilization/civ-41/civ-41-commentary.md); GB stub: [gb-10-commentary](../lectures/great-books/gb-10/gb-10-commentary.md) (dual-route Part VI + Part VII).
