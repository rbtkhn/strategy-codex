## Summary

Research notes from Moonshots episode #237. Use for work-dev alignment, integration design, and Grace-Mar positioning.

## 1. What OpenClaw Is (User Perspective)

> "OpenClaw is basically an open-source, fully customizable, self-improving, self-learning, self-evolving, personal AI agent."

**Core components:**
- AI model + scheduling + memory system
- Lives locally on computer
- Can do anything on the computer the user can do
- Learns as it goes; improves over time

**"Claw-pilled" moment:** When it figures out how to do something you didn't specify — experiments, fails, retries, succeeds. Cloud APIs (Anthropic, OpenAI) have guardrails; OpenClaw can "try different things."

**Netscape moment:** Paradigm for a new layer in the software 2.0 stack on top of reasoning models — 24/7 autonomous agent, headless, messaging interface.

---

## 2. Grace-Mar Alignment: Record as Identity Source

**Alex Finn's advice:** "Tell OpenClaw everything about yourself, your career, your goals, your ambitions, things going on in your personal life. Then say: based on what you know about me and my missions and objectives, what are five high-lever tasks you can do right now?"

**Implication:** OpenClaw expects and benefits from a rich identity substrate. Today users manually "drill in" mission statements and context. Grace-Mar's Record → OpenClaw `user.md` / `SOUL.md` (**self** / identity export) is exactly that substrate — but **structured, evidence-linked, companion-owned, and gated**. Differentiation: Grace-Mar provides the *canonical* identity layer; companion controls what enters it.

**Apple vision (Alex):** Integrate OpenClaw into macOS — Apple knows you (Apple ID), builds widgets on the fly, "build me the apps I need when I need them." Grace-Mar's model inverts: identity comes from companion-owned Record, not vendor-held data.

---

## 3. Memory Architecture

**OpenClaw memory (paraphrased for Grace-Mar vocabulary):** Described as markdown on disk — memory, **self** (identity), instructions, agent, bundled as files. *(Third-party wording sometimes used other terms; here **self** matches SELF / Record language in this repo.)*

**Alignment:** Grace-Mar Record (SELF, EVIDENCE, SKILLS, etc.) is also markdown. Shared substrate. Export formats (user.md, manifest) fit OpenClaw's consumption model.

**Memory improvement (Alex):** When OpenClaw forgets something, ask: (1) Why did you forget that? (2) What can you fix so you never forget again? It edits its own memory system. Grace-Mar's gated pipeline is the opposite: the companion gates what enters; the agent does not self-edit. Our boundary is stronger.

**Large knowledge bases:** Alex uses Gemma (small local model) for memory retrieval. Custom systems for e.g. 500 YouTube transcripts. Grace-Mar's self-library, IX-A/B/C, and lookup flow serve a similar role — structured, not raw ingestion.

---

## 4. Local vs VPS

**Alex:** "VPS route is bad in basically every measurable facet — significantly worse than local."

| Factor | Local | VPS |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Speed | Better | Slower |
| Customization | Any platform/app/tool on device | Limited |
| Scalability | 4 OpenClaws 24/7 feasible | Cost explodes |
| Security | "Secure by default" | Keys exposed in breaches |

**Implication:** Grace-Mar ↔ OpenClaw integration scenarios:
- **Sibling repos / shared workspace:** Both local. Export runs locally; handback runs locally. Secure.
- **OpenClaw on VPS:** Export may be pulled by remote agent. Handback from VPS → Grace-Mar raises provenance and security questions. Document that local-to-local is the preferred topology.

---

## 5. Security: Injection and Third-Party Skills

**Reported vulnerability:** "OpenClaw flaw lets any website silently hijack a developer's agent. Malicious JavaScript can connect to local gateways and gain full control." Patched within 24 hours.

**AWG (Alex Wegener-Gross):** "Dangerous world for baby AGIs" — injection attacks, no immune system, port scanning, prompt injection from websites innocuous to humans but fatal to agents.

**Alex Finn on third-party skills:** "I do not trust anyone's skills or plugins. I think it's the biggest attack vector. You're safer allowing your OpenClaw to read the open web and your emails than installing people's skills." Prefers: give OpenClaw a link to a skill, say "build your own version."

**Grace-Mar relevance:**
- `openclaw_stage` and `openclaw_hook` are first-party, auditable. We control the surface.
- Handback receives content from OpenClaw; constitutional check runs before staging. Reduces injection risk into Record.
- work-dev docs should note: prefer Grace-Mar-native tooling over third-party OpenClaw skills for Record sync.

## 6. Organizational Model: Hierarchy and Oversight

**Alex's setup:** CEO (Alex) → Henry (chief of staff, Opus 4.6) → Ralph (engineering manager, ChatGPT OOTH) → Charlie, Quill, Scout (specialists).

**Henry:** Orchestrator, best model, makes decisions. Alex only talks to Henry.  
**Ralph:** Oversees Charlie; "Ralph loop" — checks every 10 minutes to ensure Charlie stays on track.  
**Sub-agents vs separate OpenClaws:** Sub-agents = one OpenClaw wearing different hats. Separate OpenClaws = different context, memories, skill sets per device.

**Grace-Mar alignment:** Triadic cognition — MIND (companion), RECORD (Grace-Mar), VOICE (Grace-Mar). The companion is the top of the hierarchy; OpenClaw (or Henry) is an instrument that serves the companion. Our docs already frame OpenClaw as consumer of identity, not co-equal. This research reinforces: human holds the reins; agents are below-stairs.

---

## 7. Hybrid and OOTH

**Hybrid approach:** Local OpenClaw (Quen) does heavy work 24/7; cloud (e.g. ChatGPT) checks periodically for oversight. Capped cost (subscription), not pay-per-token surprise.

**OOTH:** Use login/subsidized tokens. OpenAI encourages; Anthropic discourages; Google banned then unbanned. Terms-of-service gray area.

**Implication for benchmarks:** Track cost per export/handback. Hybrid users may have lower per-task cost; OOTH changes economics vs pure API.

---

## 8. Use Cases and Workflows

**Alex's lanes:** Software factory (agents building together), content creation (Discord pipeline: trending tweets → research → scripts → approval → thumbnails).

**Passive coding:** "Work on this game for the next 12 hours" — multi-level orchestration, oversight loops.

**Reverse prompting:** Install OpenClaw, tell it everything, ask "what are 5 high-lever tasks?" — it proposes; user implements.

**Handback pattern:** OpenClaw produces artifacts (code, summaries, scripts). User says "we did X" → pipeline. Our `openclaw_stage` formalizes that: `--text "we explored fractions"` or `--artifact ./session-note.md`.

---

## 9. Variants and Ecosystem

- **Pico Claw:** Edge, Raspberry Pi, <10MB RAM
- **Iron Claw:** Rust-based
- **Nano Claw:** Security focus
- **Nanobot:** Python-based, easy to understand

**Cambrian explosion** — many claw variants. Grace-Mar's integration targets the core paradigm (identity, continuity, handback); implementation details may vary by variant. Keep integration guide variant-agnostic where possible.

## 10. Actionable Takeaways for work-dev

| Takeaway | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Record as identity is the core value prop | Strengthen messaging: "Tell OpenClaw everything" → Grace-Mar gives you a canonical, gated, evidence-linked everything |
| Memory = markdown | Emphasize format compatibility in integration guide |
| Local preferred over VPS | Add topology note: local-to-local preferred; VPS handback has additional provenance/security considerations |
| Third-party skills = attack vector | Recommend Grace-Mar native tooling over third-party Record sync skills |
| Oversight loops (Ralph) | Session continuity + RECURSION-GATE read supports human-in-the-loop; document as part of "before OpenClaw session" checklist |
| Hybrid / OOTH economics | Economic benchmarks should accommodate mixed cost models |
