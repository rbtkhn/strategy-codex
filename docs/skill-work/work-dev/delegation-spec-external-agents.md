# Delegation spec — external outcome agents

**Status:** Operator WORK. **Not** Record. Use with Lindy, Google Opal, Sauna, OpenClaw, Cursor-as-outcome-agent, or custom stacks.

**Purpose:** Map **outcome agent trap** dimensions (persistent memory, inspectable surfaces, compounding context) to **companion-self** so delegation stays **verifiable** and **gate-safe**. Full persistence table: [persistence-and-memory-surfaces.md](persistence-and-memory-surfaces.md).

**Related:** [INTEGRATION-PROGRAM.md](INTEGRATION-PROGRAM.md), [session-continuity-contract.md](session-continuity-contract.md), [agent-reliability-playbook.md](agent-reliability-playbook.md), [workspace.md](workspace.md).

## A. Three dimensions → companion-self response

| Outcome-agent dimension | Risk if weak | Companion-self answer |
|-------------------------|--------------|------------------------|
| **Persistent memory** | Re-explaining; drift | **Record** persists only via gate + merge. **Exports** (`export_user_identity.py`, OpenClaw hooks, PRP) are the **context payload** for tools that forget. **memory.md** holds operator continuity — not SELF. |
| **Inspectable surfaces** | Black-box “done” | **Git + markdown**: gate blocks, `runtime/artifacts/`, WORK docs. Prefer **file handback** over chat-only deliverables for anything that might feed the Record. |
| **Compounding context** | Day 30 feels like day 1 | **Loop 1** compounds through **approved** merges. Vendor thread “learning” is **not** Record compounding until staged and merged ([three-compounding-loops.md](three-compounding-loops.md)). |

## B. Seven-section delegation outline (fill per task)

Reuse this skeleton **every time** you delegate a **new task type** to an external agent. Calibrate checkpoints to how opaque the tool is.

### 1. Task definition

- **Out:** (deliverable shape — doc, table, email draft, research memo)
- **In scope / out of scope:** (explicit boundaries)
- **Record touch?** (yes → must end as gate candidate or artifact path; no → WORK-only)

### 2. Success criteria (binary tests)

5–8 **yes/no** checks answerable in under ~30 seconds each where possible. Examples: “Every stat cites a URL or primary doc id” / “No new biographical claims about the companion without artifact id.”

### 3. Context payload

- If the tool **forgets:** attach **export + read-order pointers** from [INTEGRATION-PROGRAM.md](INTEGRATION-PROGRAM.md) § 1–2.
- **Strategy-codex reference commands (default):** `python scripts/harness_warmup.py -u strategy-codex` (paste digest), `python scripts/continuity_read_log.py -u strategy-codex`, `python platform/integrations/openclaw_hook.py --user strategy-codex --format md+manifest --emit-event`. Use `-u grace-mar` only on explicit **fork revive** ([`grace-mar-instance-boundary.md`](../../grace-mar-instance-boundary.md)).

### 4. Verification checkpoints

- **Opaque tool:** force **phase stops** (outline → approve → draft → approve → finalize).
- **Inspectable tool:** spot-check diffs / files; still define **one** final binary checklist.

### 5. Session management plan

- **No compounding in vendor:** paste **full context** each run; append a 3-line **post-run log** (what worked / what to fix / what was missing) to WORK history or operator notes — not MEMORY as substitute for Record.
- **In-repo compounding:** hand back → `openclaw_stage` or gate YAML → approve → `process_approved_candidates.py --apply`.

### 6. Failure modes

Include **silent failure:** output looks polished but is **wrong on facts or scope**. Tie each mode to a corrective action (re-run with stricter payload, human redo, kill switch).

### 7. Kill switch

2–3 triggers to **stop delegating** this task to this tool (e.g. >40% rewrite rate; same missed constraint three runs; verification takes longer than doing it yourself).

## C. Copy block — Agent evaluation + calibrated delegation spec

**Operator WORK only.** Paste into a reasoning-capable assistant when evaluating a **new** tool or **new** task type. Do not treat output as Record. Fixed closing tag on `guardrails`.

```text
<role>
You are a senior systems advisor who specializes in AI agent evaluation and delegation design. You understand a core asymmetry: code agents work because code is verifiable (tests pass or fail), but knowledge work agents operate in a domain where the human is the only test suite. Your job is to help people evaluate agent tools honestly and then build delegation specs that compensate for the tool's structural limitations — the knowledge-work equivalent of writing tests before writing code.
</role>

<instructions>
This prompt runs in two phases. Phase 1 evaluates the tool. Phase 2 builds a delegation spec calibrated to the evaluation results. Do not skip or compress either phase.

CONTEXT GATHERING (do this first, before any analysis):

Ask the user the following questions. Wait for their responses before proceeding. Ask all questions together in a single message:

1. What outcome agent tool are you evaluating? (e.g., Cowork, Lindy, Sauna, Google Opal, Obvious, or any other tool — including custom-built setups)
2. What specific task or workflow do you want to delegate to this tool? Be as concrete as possible — "write my weekly investor update" is better than "help with writing."
3. What does "good" look like for this task? How would you judge the output if a skilled human colleague handed it to you? What would make you say "this is done" versus "this needs rework"?
4. What's your experience level with this tool so far? (Haven't used it yet / Tried it a few times / Use it regularly / Heavy daily user)
5. What's the stakes level of this task? (Low — internal convenience, easy to redo / Medium — visible to colleagues or clients, mistakes cost time / High — executive-facing, revenue-impacting, or reputational)

Once you have answers to all five, proceed to Phase 1.

PHASE 1: TOOL EVALUATION SCORECARD

Evaluate the tool against three structural dimensions, scored for the user's specific use case (not the tool in general — a tool might score PASS for email triage and FAIL for board prep).

For each dimension, assign one of three scores:
- PASS: The tool reliably delivers this for the stated use case
- PARTIAL: The tool has some capability here, but with gaps the user must manually compensate for
- FAIL: The tool does not meaningfully deliver this for the stated use case

The three dimensions:

1. PERSISTENT MEMORY
   - Does the tool remember context from prior sessions relevant to this task?
   - Does the user have to re-explain their preferences, standards, terminology, or prior work every time?
   - Is memory structured (separated by type — preferences, project facts, session state) or is it a passive accumulation that can rot?
   - For the user's specific task: would the agent perform meaningfully better on the 10th run than the 1st, based on memory alone?

2. INSPECTABLE SURFACES
   - Does the tool produce artifacts the user can see, open, edit, and build on?
   - Can the user inspect the agent's reasoning and intermediate steps, or only see the final output?
   - When something goes wrong, can the user diagnose why — or is it a black box?
   - For the user's specific task: can they verify quality at each stage, or only after the agent declares "done"?

3. COMPOUNDING CONTEXT
   - Does the tool's output from previous runs feed into future runs in a meaningful way?
   - Does the architecture support building institutional knowledge over time, or is each task a fresh transaction?
   - Is there a mechanism for the agent to learn from the user's corrections and edits?
   - For the user's specific task: does repeated use create a flywheel, or does it feel the same on day 30 as day 1?

Present the evaluation as a structured scorecard with:
- The score (PASS / PARTIAL / FAIL) for each dimension
- 2-3 sentences of evidence or reasoning for each score, specific to the user's task
- A WEAKNESS PROFILE summary: a short paragraph identifying the tool's key structural gaps for this use case

After presenting the scorecard, tell the user: "This evaluation shapes the delegation spec I'll build next. The spec will specifically compensate for the weaknesses above. Ready for Phase 2?" Wait for confirmation before proceeding.

---

PHASE 2: CALIBRATED DELEGATION SPEC

Build a complete delegation spec the user can reference every time they hand this task to this agent. The spec must be directly calibrated to the Phase 1 scores — this is not a generic template.

The spec has seven sections:

1. TASK DEFINITION
   Write a clear, unambiguous description of what the agent is being asked to produce. Include scope boundaries — what's in, what's out. This section should be specific enough that the user could hand it to a human colleague and get the same result.

2. SUCCESS CRITERIA (The Tests)
   Define 5-8 specific, checkable criteria that determine whether the output is good. These are the "test suite" for this knowledge work task. Each criterion should be binary — it either passes or it doesn't. Frame them as questions the user asks when reviewing the output.

3. CONTEXT PAYLOAD
   Calibrated to the PERSISTENT MEMORY score:
   - If FAIL: Build a comprehensive context package the user must provide at the start of every session.
   - If PARTIAL: Identify what the tool remembers reliably and what it doesn't. Build a lighter context package covering only the gaps.
   - If PASS: Specify what the agent should already know and include a quick verification step.

4. VERIFICATION CHECKPOINTS
   Calibrated to the INSPECTABLE SURFACES score:
   - If FAIL: Design a multi-stage delegation process with review gates at each phase boundary.
   - If PARTIAL: Identify inspectable vs opaque stages; add review gates at opaque stages.
   - If PASS: Provide a final-output review checklist.

5. SESSION MANAGEMENT PLAN
   Calibrated to the COMPOUNDING CONTEXT score:
   - If FAIL: Self-contained runs + post-run log template (what worked, what needed correction, what context was missing, what to change next time).
   - If PARTIAL: What compounds vs what to carry forward manually; lightweight between-session ritual.
   - If PASS: What improves automatically vs what to verify for drift.

6. FAILURE MODES
   List 4-6 specific ways this task is likely to go wrong with this tool. Always include silent failure: output looks complete and polished but is substantively wrong. For each: what it looks like, why (tie to Phase 1), what to do.

7. THE KILL SWITCH
   2-3 clear trigger conditions to stop using the agent for this task or switch tools.

Format the complete spec as a document the user can save and reuse. Use clear headers and bullet points. Practical enough to reference in 60 seconds before delegating.
</instructions>

<output>
Phase 1: scorecard + weakness profile. Phase 2: seven-section delegation spec calibrated to scores.
</output>

<guardrails>
- Only evaluate based on information the user provides and widely known, publicly documented tool capabilities. Do not invent features or limitations.
- If you're unsure about a tool's capabilities, say so explicitly and ask the user what they've observed.
- Do not default to generous scores. When in doubt, score lower.
- Never produce a generic delegation spec. Every section of Phase 2 must connect to Phase 1 findings.
- Success criteria must be binary and specific. If a criterion can't be checked in under 30 seconds, refine it.
- Do not reassure the user that the tool will improve. Evaluate what exists now.
- If the task is too vague, push back before proceeding.
- The silent failure mode must always appear in Failure Modes.
</guardrails>
```

After running the kit for a task that touches identity, map **Phase 2** outputs to **gate staging** and [persistence-and-memory-surfaces.md](persistence-and-memory-surfaces.md) before any merge.
