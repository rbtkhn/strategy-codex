# work-dev workspace

Canonical operator entrypoint for the `work-dev` territory.

Use this file when you want one place to understand:

- what parts of the Grace-Mar â†” OpenClaw integration are real today
- what is only documented or aspirational
- where provenance or observability is weak
- how the territory could become a real business
- what should be checked next

## Related territory: template sync (not OpenClaw)

**[`work-companion-self`](../work-companion-self/README.md)** â€” grace-mar â†” companion-self drift, `template_diff.py`, manifest audits, upstream PRs. Use that folder for **template governance**; use **this** folder for **OpenClaw / exports / continuity / CI**. See also [MERGING-FROM-COMPANION-SELF](../../merging-from-companion-self.md).

## Current state summary

| Area | Current state |
|------|---------------|
| **Identity export** | Implemented through `integrations/openclaw_hook.py` and the runtime bundle export path |
| **Stage-only handback** | Implemented through `integrations/openclaw_stage.py` â†’ `/stage` |
| **Pipeline-level export audit** | Implemented via `runtime_compat_export` events and harness events |
| **Constitution advisory event** | Implemented via `intent_constitutional_critique` event emission |
| **End-to-end provenance** | Implemented: OpenClaw payload (source=openclaw_stage) flows as staging_meta into gate; candidate blocks carry candidate_source, artifact_*, constitution_*; recursion_gate_review parses them for review/benchmarks |
| **Session continuity receipts** | **Implemented contract:** [session-continuity-contract.md](session-continuity-contract.md) â€” files + `continuity_preflight.py` / `verify_continuity_receipt.py` + handback enforcement; not â€œagent remembers.â€ OpenClaw `/stage` requires a fresh valid receipt. |
| **Session continuity event logging** | **Partial observability:** denial/block events can append to local `runtime/observability/continuity_blocks.jsonl`; the feed is gitignored unless exported and remains an observability surface, not an operational guarantee. |
| **Derived regeneration foundation** | **Partial:** repo-owned [derived-regeneration.md](derived-regeneration.md) now includes a phase-1 change detector, regeneration entrypoint, rebuild receipts, a generated target manifest, and rebuild-health telemetry for a small initial target set. Runtime-triggered rebuild requests remain explicitly deferred. |
| **YouTube / transcript tooling** | **Partial:** the active seam is split across `scripts/youtube_transcripts/*`, `scripts/backfill_*_youtube_raw_input.py`, `scripts/build_dialogue_works_metadata_index.py`, and `scripts/assess_session_load.py`; keep it as its own commit bucket instead of folding it into docs-only cleanup. |

**Mirror (OpenClaw surfaces):** Full rowsâ€”including compute-ledger (**`partial`**), local topology (**`implemented`**), and VPS caveat (**`documented_only`**)â€”live in [`integration-status.md`](integration-status.md); this summary stays headline-only.

## Operator path

0. When debugging agent vs repo behavior, read `agentic-environment-principles.md` (environment before prompt).
1. Open `integration-status.md` to see what is implemented, partial, or only documented.
2. Read `known-gaps.md` before assuming a workflow is operational.
3. Use `provenance-checklist.md` when validating export, handback, or merge-followthrough behavior.
4. Check `economic-benchmarks.md` before claiming observability or benchmark coverage.
5. Update `integration-status.md` and `known-gaps.md` after any real test or implementation change.

## Business layer

This territory now has three lanes:

| Lane | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Doctrine** | Why the territory exists and what it believes about portable, governed AI systems |
| **Operator** | What is real today, what is partial, and what needs verification |
| **Business** | What the future company would sell, to whom, and how delivery could work |

Use the business lane when the question is not "is this implemented?" but "how could this become a client-services company?"

Crypto belongs adjacent to these lanes as a future **authority / settlement / access** layer, not as a prerequisite for current operator work.

## Current blockers

| Blocker | Why it matters |
|---------|----------------|
| ~~**Handback provenance is not preserved cleanly into `recursion-gate.md`**~~ | Resolved: OpenClaw payload sets candidate_source + artifact/constitution fields in gate (handback_server + core + recursion_gate_review). |
| **Benchmark docs overstate current instrumentation** | Mitigated: `economic-benchmarks.md` distinguishes automatic pipeline emission vs manual/derivation; re-audit after hook changes |
| **Continuity event logging is local residue** | Receipt enforcement is implemented, but `runtime/observability/continuity_blocks.jsonl` remains gitignored/local unless exported; do not treat the observability feed as durable state. |
| **Derived rebuild orchestration is still shallow** | Phase-1 repo-owned regeneration exists, but target coverage is intentionally small; manifest and health summary now exist, while broader incremental depth and any runtime rebuild request channel remain future phases |

---

## Next actions

1. ~~Preserve OpenClaw-specific provenance end-to-end from `openclaw_stage.py` through `/stage` into staged candidates.~~ Done.
2. ~~Mark benchmark rows as instrumented, manual, planned, or blocked instead of implying they all exist today.~~ Done (see `economic-benchmarks.md` definitions and tables).
3. ~~CI wiring for `continuity_read_log.py`~~ Done (`tests/test_continuity_read_log.py`). ~~Optional: OpenClaw startup wrapper~~ `scripts/openclaw_session_continuity.sh` appends JSONL then runs the rest of the command. Receipt enforcement is now the stronger operational contract; continuity block logging remains local observability.
4. ~~Refresh stale derived exports (`manifest.json`, `llms.txt`, `intent_snapshot.json`, `fork-manifest.json`, PRP, runtime bundle). Validator flags these; run `refresh_derived_exports.py` after confirming no Record changes are pending.~~ Done (2026-04-12: `refresh_derived_exports.py -u grace-mar`; commit `3a17caf`).
5. ~~Pick only between BUILD-AI-GAP-005 and BUILD-AI-GAP-006 as the next blocker~~ â€” Incremental slice landed: matrix `--check` + pytest drift on `handback_tail_stress.matrix.md`, optional `staged_risk_tier` narrative guard in `validate_handback_analysis.py` (commit `aa1417c`). Both gaps remain `partial` (client tail YAMLs; full semantic alignment; wiring `staged_risk_tier` from `/stage` when ready). **GAP-007:** dashboard + harness + **Tests workflow smoke** (`evaluate_autonomy_tiers.py` â†’ `insufficient_data` cold path) â€” see `autonomy/tier_policy.md`; gap stays **`partial`** until operator habit / optional UI. **Choose next wedge:** deeper tail scenarios (**GAP-005/006**) or **OB1 chunking** (#6) when bridge exporter / PR4 is queued.
6. **Derived regeneration roadmap:** keep [derived-regeneration.md](derived-regeneration.md) as the repo-owned phase map. Next wedges, in order: deepen the rebuild foundation (manifest breadth + stronger incremental ordering), then **GAP-005**, **GAP-006**, **GAP-007**, then richer rebuild-health summaries, then any runtime rebuild-request channel.
7. OB1 chunking spike â€” when demand materializes: export one real `self.md` under each strategy, measure retrieval precision, pick the winner. Blocking prerequisite for the bridge exporter (PR 4). See `docs/integrations/ob1/architecture.md` Â§ Known technical risks.
8. Apply risk-mitigation template (success criteria, sustainment, deprecation, scope creep) to remaining uncovered territories: ~~`work-politics`~~ (**done 2026-04-18** â€” see `docs/skill-work/work-politics/README.md` Â§ *Risk mitigation (template â€” Tier 1+)*), ~~`work-civ-mem`~~ (**done 2026-04-18** â€” see `docs/skill-work/work-civ-mem/README.md` Â§ *Risk mitigation (template â€” Tier 1+)*), ~~`work-cici`~~ (**done 2026-04-15** â€” see `docs/skill-work/work-cici/README.md` Â§ *Risk mitigation (template â€” Tier 1+)*). Template: `docs/skill-work/work-template/README.md` Â§ Risk-mitigation checklist. **Lane sweep complete** â€” use template when adding new long-lived WORK territories.

This workspace is for operator truth, not marketing truth. If a capability is only documented, say so plainly.
