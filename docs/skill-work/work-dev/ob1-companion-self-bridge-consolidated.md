# Companion-self ↔ Open Brain (OB1) bridge — consolidated plan

**Purpose:** Single reference for bidirectional integration between a **companion-self** instance (git, gated Record) and an **OB1** deployment (Supabase, thoughts, MCP).  
**Status:** Planning / feasibility — not an implementation commitment.  
**Scope:** Operator and template-maintainer audience; not Record truth.

**Related:** [openclaw-integration.md](../../openclaw-integration.md) (other runtime exports). **Upstream OB1:** [NateBJones-Projects/OB1](https://github.com/NateBJones-Projects/OB1).

## 1. Executive summary

**Feasibility:** Both directions are **possible**, with different safety profiles.

| Direction | Safe default | Hard part |
|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **companion-self → OB1** | Markdown/JSON **export bundle** + OB1 **recipe** ingest | Chunking, embeddings, OB1 schema version |
| **OB1 → companion-self** | **Stage to RECURSION-GATE** (or append-only MEMORY/work docs) | **Cannot** auto-merge Record — `AGENTS.md` / companion-self: merge only via approved pipeline |

**Bottom line:** **Populate OB1 from companion-self** = export + OB1 recipes (safest). **Populate companion-self from OB1** = **stage to gate** (or MEMORY/work), then **existing pipeline** — the only approach consistent with companion sovereignty and the gated Record.

### Governing doctrine for OB1 evolution

Evolving an OB1 deployment toward companion-self–grade governance is **incremental**: add **staging** first so drafts and retrieved content do not masquerade as canonical; then **approval** so incorporation requires the merge contract; then **integrity** checks (exports, provenance, drift); then **interface** discipline so the Voice answers inside scope and abstains outside it. Deeper identity capabilities belong after those membranes exist—otherwise convenience habits harden and later safeguards feel like friction. This subsection is **operator/template doctrine** for planning (including named instances such as companion-xavier), not companion Record truth. Normative reference: [Architecture — State governance](../../architecture.md#state-governance-proposed-interface-and-canonical); bridge decision record: [ADR: Asymmetric bridge](../../integrations/ob1/adr-asymmetric-bridge.md) § Doctrine alignment.

## 2. System context

| System | Canonical shape (relevant here) |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| **companion-self** | Git repo: `self.md`, `self-archive.md`, `recursion-gate.md`, `session-log.md`, `archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/prompt.py`, optional `memory.md` — **human-gated Record** in markdown. |
| **OB1** | **Supabase + thoughts** (and related), vector search, MCP — exports/recipes produce **portable dumps** (JSON, markdown) depending on upstream tooling. |

Grace-mar already has **read-only exports** for other runtimes (`docs/openclaw-integration.md`); there is **no** current bidirectional OB1 script in this repo.

---

## 3. Direction A: companion-self → OB1

### Architecture (two tiers)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph cs [companion-self repo]
    Self[self.md]
    Evid[self-archive.md]
    Mem[memory.md]
  end
  subgraph tier1 [Tier 1 - portable]
    Export[export script read-only]
    Bundle[Markdown or JSON bundle]
  end
  subgraph ob1 [OB1]
    Recipe[Existing recipe or manual ingest]
    DB[(Supabase thoughts)]
  end
  Self --> Export
  Evid --> Export
  Mem --> Export
  Export --> Bundle
  Bundle --> Recipe
  Recipe --> DB
```

**Tier 1 — Export bundle + OB1-native ingest (best first ship)**

- Script walks ``, emits deterministic files + metadata sidecars (source path, ACT-/READ- ids, git hash).
- User runs an OB1 **recipe** (or adapted Obsidian-style importer) so embeddings stay in OB1’s pipeline.

**Tier 2 — Direct Supabase insert**

- Pinned OB1 schema; handles embeddings, RLS, dedup — higher maintenance.

### Governance (CS → OB1)

- **`--include` / `--exclude`** flags so session-log, pending gate, or sensitive MEMORY are not leaked by default.
- **One-way convenience:** OB1 is a **downstream consumer** of exports; it does not own the Record.

---

## 4. Direction B: OB1 → companion-self

The Record is **companion-owned** and merges **only after approval** through **RECURSION-GATE** (`process_approved_candidates.py`). There is **no** supported pattern of dumping thoughts straight into `self.md` without breaking the pipeline contract.

### Architecture

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  subgraph ob1 [OB1]
    DB[(thoughts)]
    Export[Export API or SQL dump or recipe JSON]
  end
  subgraph bridge [Bridge script]
    Map[normalize + map fields]
    Stage[write gate blocks or MEMORY]
  end
  subgraph cs [companion-self]
    Gate[recursion-gate.md pending]
    Mem[memory.md optional]
    Merge[process_approved_candidates.py]
  end
  DB --> Export
  Export --> Map
  Map --> Stage
  Stage --> Gate
  Gate --> Merge
  Mem -.->|"ephemeral continuity only"| Stage
```

**Tier 1 — Stage-only import (correct default)**

1. **Extract** from OB1: official export path (backup, recipe output, or Supabase `select` with service role — **operator-local**, secrets not committed).
2. **Transform** into **`CANDIDATE-XXXX` YAML blocks** matching `recursion-gate.md`: `summary`, `profile_target`, `source_exchange` (OB1 id + text), `channel_key: operator:ob1-import`.
3. **Append** under `## Candidates` with `status: pending` → companion approves → `process_approved_candidates.py`.
4. **Never** write `self.md` / `self-archive.md` / `archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/prompt.py` directly from this script.

**Optional — MEMORY / WORK (non-Record)**

- Append to **`memory.md`** only per `docs/memory-template.md` (ephemeral, non-authoritative); OB1-sourced lines are **pointers**, not new SELF facts.
- **WORK** markdown (e.g. `work-*.md`) can hold methodology mirrors — not Record until gated.

**Tier 2 — Suggest EVIDENCE-shaped entries**

- Emit files under `staging/ob1-import/` for manual gate creation — more friction, clearer audit.

### Governance (OB1 → CS) — non-negotiables

- **Canonical truth:** **companion-self Record wins** for identity; OB1 is **source material**.
- **Knowledge boundary:** OB1 text may include model fluff — apply the same **grounded** checklist as any candidate (`recursion-gate.md`).
- **No automatic loop:** No unattended OB1 ↔ git sync — avoids drift and merge pain.

---

## 5. Script placement

- **Primary:** **companion-self** template — e.g. `scripts/export_open_brain_bundle.py`, `scripts/import_ob1_to_gate.py`, or `scripts/ob1_bridge.py` with `export` / `import-stage`.
- **Grace-mar:** Doc links + optional thin wrappers; avoid duplicating logic without `template_diff` discipline.

---

## 6. Implementation deliverables

**CS → OB1**

1. Spec: SELF/EVIDENCE → chunk mapping, excludes, idempotency.
2. Tier 1 export CLI + README for OB1 recipe.
3. Optional Tier 2: direct Supabase to OB1.

**OB1 → CS**

1. Spec: OB1 thought fields → gate YAML; museum knowledge section A/B/C mapping vs reject-as-raw.
2. Tier 1: `import-stage` CLI → appends gate blocks + prints next steps (review / approve / `process_approved_candidates.py`).
3. Optional: MEMORY-only flag with explicit banner.

**Cross-cutting:** Technical feasibility study (section 7) before large build.

---

## 7. Technical feasibility study

**Recommendation:** Produce before heavy engineering — turns “possible” into **scoped** go/no-go. Target **10–20 pages max** or one dense memo.

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Goals / non-goals** | Tier 1 only first; no bidirectional cron; minors / redaction. |
| **OB1 surface audit** | Pin an OB1 **release/tag**: thought table, recipes, embeddings, RLS. Spike: sample export or local run. |
| **Companion-self contract** | Files touched, gate YAML, `process_approved_candidates` invariants. |
| **Mapping matrices** | CS→OB1 chunks; OB1→CS → `profile_target` / reject rules. |
| **Risk register** | Schema drift, secrets, duplicates on re-import, KB leakage into gate. |
| **Go / no-go** | Tier 1 vs Tier 2; pilot (one user, one direction first). |

**Outcome:** Go with Tier 1, go with listed spikes, or defer until OB1 export stabilizes.

---

## 8. Supporting artifacts

| Artifact | Why |
|----------|-----|
| **Pilot protocol** | Metrics: time-to-first-thought in OB1; gate review time; zero accidental SELF edits. |
| **Threat / privacy one-pager** | What never leaves the repo; cloud DB implications. |
| **OB1 version pin policy** | Renovation rhythm; breaking-change response. |
| **Single-direction MVP** | Ship **CS→OB1** *or* **OB1→CS** first. |
| **Grace-mar pointer** | Link from `work-dev-sources.md` once bridge lives in companion-self. |
| **Template PR checklist** | Scripts, tests, no secrets in repo. |

---

## 9. Document bundle

**Must-have**

| Doc | Contents |
|-----|----------|
| **Technical feasibility study** | Go/no-go, OB1 pin, risks, spikes. |
| **Bridge architecture overview** | Diagrams, truth path, no auto-merge for OB1→CS. |
| **Mapping specification** | `MAPPING-cs-to-ob1` + `MAPPING-ob1-to-cs` (or one doc, two parts). |
| **Operator runbooks** | Export + import-stage. |
| **Governance addendum** | `AGENTS.md`, gate, merge script, companion approval. |

**Should-have:** Security & secrets; privacy / data classification; OB1 version policy; ADR (stage-only; Tier 1 first); troubleshooting / FAQ.

**Nice-to-have:** Pilot report template; glossary; minimal companion-facing FAQ if ever needed.

**Where:** Authoritative copy in **companion-self** (e.g. `docs/platform/integrations/open-brain/` or `docs/ob1-bridge/`). **Grace-mar:** this file is a **consolidated mirror**; prefer linking to companion-self when the bundle lands there.

---

## 10. Open questions

- **Chunking (CS→OB1):** Per ACT vs monthly rollup?
- **OB1 export format:** Pin JSON/SQL shape to a specific OB1 release for import-stage.
- **Credentials:** Both directions = **operator machine**, not CI, for Supabase keys.

---
