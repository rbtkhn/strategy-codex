# work-dev — sources

YouTube channels, podcasts, newsletters, and **web reference outlets** the operator tracks for **work-dev framing** (integration, offers, partner vocabulary, landscape awareness). **Not** Record truth and **not** a substitute for [integration-status.md](integration-status.md) — see [external-signals.md](external-signals.md).

**Per-video registry (titles + canonical watch URLs, machine-readable JSON):** [research/external/work-dev/youtube-indexes/](../../../research/external/work-dev/youtube-indexes/) — one folder per channel; refresh listing with `fetch_youtube_channel_transcripts.py --index-only` (see that README). Each channel has **`ingestion.json`**: operator marks whether an episode has been **manually ingested** (digest/transcript in-repo) and links artifact paths; `render_youtube_work_dev_catalog.py` writes **`CHANNEL-CATALOG.md`** and **`episode-catalog.json`** with an `ingested` field per video. Keeps provenance for long-horizon research. The table below stays **channel-level** so this page stays scannable.

**Principle:** [Work modules — authorized sources lists](../work-modules-sources-principle.md).

**Companion-self ↔ Open Brain (OB1) bridge (planning):** [ob1-companion-self-bridge-consolidated.md](ob1-companion-self-bridge-consolidated.md) — single reference for bidirectional integration, governance, feasibility study scope, and document bundle (WORK lane; authoritative bundle may later live in companion-self).

**Mediamap exclusions:** ~1,840 links covering politically-aligned outlets (Left through Right), colleges, book lists, polling, news aggregators, and civics education were excluded. Several (Cook Political Report, BallotPedia, OpenSecrets, C-SPAN, Lawfare, War on the Rocks, Foreign Affairs, etc.) belong in **work-politics** or **work-strategy** — worth a separate pass to backfill those lanes.

**Parallel (work-politics):** [../work-politics/work-politics-sources.md](../work-politics/work-politics-sources.md)

**BrewMind (Philippines pilot):** These feeds are also bundled for **micro-lesson / curriculum depth** in [../work-cici/brewmind-philippines-onboarding-guide.md](../../../singularity/work-cici/brewmind-philippines-onboarding-guide.md) § *Operator depth — work-dev sources* — PH-facing AI content online is thin; **canonical list stays this file**.
