## 1. Video theses (condensed)

- **Self-improving agents:** Whoever creates an agent that can improve itself at a comparable rate has a huge advantage. Wang thinks current models are already "past the line" on common sense, reasoning, alignment — the bottleneck is **memory** (context lens), **tools, environments, permissions, protocols**.
- **Memory:** Key bottleneck. Human memory is "hallucination" (reconstructive); alternative is offload + retrieve (vector DB, cache). Agents need to **use** memory, not just have it; long context is hard to retrieve from. Need better memory benchmarks (realistic, not just "needle in haystack").
- **Learning from failure:** Current models don't learn from failure well; when prompted "try again" they often insist on the same wrong answer. RL can make this worse. Need new algorithms for agents to really learn from failures — core for self-improvement loop.
- **Reasoning collapse:** In multi-turn agentic tasks, reasoning **length decreases** over training. Models converge to **template-like reasoning**: same reasoning set for different problems (high entropy across problems, but same "reasoning set" per problem). Not input-grounded — mutual information (given reasoning chain, can you tell which prompt?) is low. Caused by noise (task noise, entropy bonus, etc.); model stays in "safe" high-baseline-reward region.
- **World modeling:** Agent must know what happens after an action (if I push the table it moves). Important for self-improvement in real environments. Benchmarks: behavior challenge, theory of space — explore then answer.
- **True agent = environment:** "It's not the agent, it's the environment." Agent can only learn what's in the environment; single-turn feedback from own answers is limiting. Real agent needs to be **in** an environment (e.g. OpenClaw, full computer).
- **Taste and questions:** With agents that can verify answers, "the taste and the ability to raise important questions are becoming more and more important." Must decompose to concrete steps and know "what can we do right now."
- **Benchmarks:** Non-trivial baseline; understand **why** model fails (taxonomy); budget awareness (agents blow token budgets even when told not to).

## 2. What we can learn (mapped to assistant brain)

### Sovereign layer vs self-improving-agent race

- **Them:** Race to build agents that improve themselves; memory and learning-from-failure are bottlenecks; "whoever gets there first" has huge advantage.
- **Us:** We are a **counter-design**. We don't want the assistant to self-improve or retain session memory. We want the **human** to improve (test their judgment) and we want **explicit relay only**. In a world racing toward self-improving agents, we offer a **sovereign layer**: the principal stays in the loop; the system doesn't learn from the session unless the human says "record."
- **Positioning:** "While others race to build agents that improve themselves, we build a layer that improves **your** judgment — options, tensions visible, you decide; nothing written unless you say so."

### Memory: we avoid the problem by design

- **Them:** Memory is the key bottleneck for self-improving agents (context lens, retrieval, realistic benchmarks).
- **Us:** We're **stateless by default**. Bounded session, one decision, one output; no retention unless "record." We don't need to solve the agent-memory problem — we deliberately don't give the assistant long memory. Reinforces **sovereign session** and **no write unless relay** as differentiators.

### Learning from failure: human learning, not agent learning

- **Them:** Agents don't learn from failure well; need new algorithms for self-improvement loop.
- **Us:** Our "learning" is **human** learning. The principal sees A/B/C, decides, and optionally records "what did you do? what happened?" (post-decision capture). That's human reflection and explicit relay, not agent learning from failure. We don't rely on agent self-improvement; we rely on **human reflection** and the "we did X" habit. Post-decision capture is the human-in-the-loop analogue.

### Reasoning collapse: keep A/B/C input-grounded

- **Them:** In agentic training, reasoning can collapse to templates — same reasoning set for different problems; not input-grounded. Bad: mutual information between reasoning chain and prompt is low.
- **Us:** Our fixed perspectives (A/B/C) could in principle become generic "template" language. We must ensure A/B/C content is **decision-specific** (tied to the actual decision or question), not generic. Our protocol already anchors on **Context: [one line: decision or question]** — so we're input-grounded by design. **Actionable:** In prompt/spec, reinforce that each of A, B, C must be **about this decision**, not generic advice.

### World modeling → option modeling / reversibility

- **Them:** Agent needs to know what happens after an action (world modeling).
- **Us:** We're not an embodied agent. For the **principal**, the analogue is: what happens if I choose A vs B vs C? We surface **options** and **reversibility** ("what becomes irreversible"). So we're doing **option modeling** for the human — "if you do X, what becomes irreversible?" The reversibility row we added is the decision-space analogue of world modeling.

### True agent = environment → we're narrow by design

- **Them:** Real agent needs to be in an environment; single-turn feedback from own answers is limiting.
- **Us:** Our "environment" is narrow: the decision frame the user gives, optional context (calendar, briefing). We're **one principal, one decision**. We don't put the agent in a rich environment; we give it a narrow input. So we avoid the "agent needs infinite environment" problem — we're narrow by design. Good for positioning: we're not a general agent; we're a **pre-decision checkpoint**.

### Taste and important questions

- **Them:** Taste and the ability to raise important questions are becoming more important; agents can verify answers. Need to decompose to concrete steps and know what's possible now.
- **Us:** The **principal** has the taste and the questions; we surface the options. We support the human's "important questions" by giving them the full field (A/B/C). We don't replace "asking the right question" — we help once the question (decision frame) is posed. Value: the human asks; we **show** the options so they can test their judgment.

### Benchmarks and failure modes

- **Them:** Good benchmark = non-trivial, understand **why** model fails (taxonomy), budget awareness.
- **Us:** We're not benchmarking an agent. But: (a) **Calibrated abstention** — when we can't do something, say so ("do you want me to look it up?"); (b) understanding when the principal found the output useless or disagreed with all three perspectives is valuable — **post-decision capture** and "what did you do?" feed that. So we get "failure mode" insight from human feedback, not from agent benchmarks.

## 3. Actionable takeaways

| Lesson | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Sovereign layer vs self-improving race | Use in positioning: "We don't build self-improving agents; we build a layer that improves **your** judgment. Options, tensions visible, you decide; nothing written unless you say so." |
| Memory / bounded session | Keep "no retention unless you say record" and "sovereign session" in copy; we avoid the memory bottleneck by design. |
| Human learning, not agent learning | Post-decision capture ("What did you do? What happened?") and "we did X" are the human learning loop; don't promise agent self-improvement. |
| Input-grounded A/B/C | In protocol and prompt: A, B, C must be **about this decision** (this context, this question), not generic template language. Add to [../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/polyphonic-cognition-protocol-skill.md](../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/../work-politics/polyphonic-cognition-protocol-skill.md) if not already explicit. |
| Reversibility as option modeling | Already in spec; reversibility line = "what happens if I do X" for the principal. No change. |
| Narrow by design | "One principal, one decision" and "pre-decision checkpoint" already in copy. Reinforces we're not a general agent. |
| Taste and questions | We support the human who asks the right question; we show the field. No change. |

## 4. Optional copy (positioning)

- "In a world racing toward self-improving agents, we offer the opposite: a layer that improves **your** judgment. Full field, tensions visible, you decide — nothing written unless you say so."
- "We don't solve the agent-memory problem. We avoid it: your session is stateless unless you say 'record.'"
