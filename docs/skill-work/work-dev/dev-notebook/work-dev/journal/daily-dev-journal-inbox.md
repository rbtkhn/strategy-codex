# Daily dev journal inbox (accumulator)

**Purpose:** **Append-only** scratch surface for the **current local calendar day** while you work the **work-dev** lane — harness notes, integration friction, links, half-formed reflections — **before** they become the finished journal page.

**Fold at `dream`:** Synthesize into the canonical day file for this calendar window: **`YYYY-MM-DD-day-NN.md`** in this folder (**NN** = journal day number from your chosen anchor — match your latest entry or next ordinal). If that file does not exist yet, **create** it from the fold (short sections: focus, actions, wins, blockers, tomorrow — see [README](README.md)). The rolling file is **not** automatically cleared each dream; clear or trim manually when you want a fresh buffer.

**Length (scratch section only — below the append line):** When the scratch body exceeds **~20000 characters**, **prune from the top** (oldest lines first) in **~5000-character blocks** until **≤ ~20000 characters** remain (repeat if a single paste still leaves you above the limit). Re-count after large pastes.

**Missed `dream`:** Before appending on a new day, fold or merge stale content into the correct dated `*-day-NN.md` page.

**Contrast:** [work-dev-history.md](../../../work-dev-history.md) stays the **milestone** log; this inbox is a **volatile buffer** — same pattern as [strategy-notebook daily-strategy-inbox](../../../../../../codex/daily-strategy-inbox.md).

**Git:** Commits preserve history.

_(Append below this line during the day.)_

- **SemaClaw bridge proposal evaluated and rejected.** LLM-generated GitHub issue/PR templates for a "SemaClaw bridging plan" — proposed Docker profiles, React web UI, 4-layer plugin architecture, multi-channel adapters (Feishu/QQ/Discord), plugin loader, schema-registry, marketplace. Evaluated against actual repo: ~60% premature infrastructure, ~20% already exists (Docker Compose, gate-review app, MCP adapter Wave 4B, PR template, `platform/src/grace_mar/`), ~20% architecturally wrong (treats Grace-Mar as multi-tenant SaaS, not sovereign single-companion system). Rejected wholesale. The proposal was generated without reading the repo.

### Executive Report: Why the Latest Grace-Mar Changes Matter

The recent Grace-Mar updates are important because they move the project from a smart collection of tools into a more disciplined operating system for trustworthy AI-assisted work. In plain terms, the repo is becoming better at answering three business-critical questions: **Who did what, why did they do it, and how much trust should we place in the result?** The latest public commits show meaningful progress on all three. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

The most strategically important change is the new **Comprehension Envelope governance**. That sounds technical, but the business meaning is simple: the system is beginning to require not just output, but evidence of understanding. In an AI-heavy workflow, that matters because generating content is cheap; the scarce asset is knowing whether a person actually understood the tradeoffs, risks, and implications of what was generated. This change is an early foundation for preventing “looks good” work from being mistaken for “is good” work. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

A simple example: before this change, an operator might produce a proposal or system update that appears polished but gives little visibility into why a path was chosen or what could break. With Comprehension Envelope governance in place, Grace-Mar is moving toward a model where important changes can carry lightweight evidence of human judgment. For a manager, that means fewer hidden assumptions, fewer accidental high-impact mistakes, and a better audit trail when something needs to be reviewed later. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

The second major development is the addition of **worker registry and worker overlays** in the runtime architecture. Business-wise, this means Grace-Mar is becoming more modular and more scalable. Instead of one undifferentiated AI process trying to do everything, the system is starting to define specialized workers and configurable overlays for different kinds of tasks. That is the difference between “one smart assistant” and a small managed workforce with clearer roles. It improves maintainability, makes behavior easier to reason about, and lowers the chance that one change will unpredictably affect unrelated workflows. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

A practical example: one worker can specialize in strategy-notebook inspection while another follows a different overlay for research or review. That separation makes it easier to improve one capability without destabilizing the whole system. For leadership, this matters because it reduces operational fragility and makes future expansion cheaper and safer. The repo is not just adding features; it is adding organizational structure to how AI labor is performed. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

The third important cluster of changes is around **review orchestration, anchor fidelity, phase sequencing, and workflow depth control**. These sound like implementation details, but together they improve process discipline. The system is getting better at ensuring that a task stays tied to its original intent, that steps happen in a named order, and that work does not expand indefinitely once diminishing returns set in. In business terms, this is about reducing drift, wasted effort, and “AI wandering.” ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

An example here is the new emphasis on **task anchors** and **phase receipts**. That means the system can better show that a piece of work remained faithful to the original request and moved through a recognizable process. For a non-technical boss, the significance is straightforward: better predictability, cleaner accountability, and less risk that the AI produces something elaborate but off-target. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

The update to **strategy-notebook terminology and templates** also matters more than it appears. Renaming and reorganizing structures is not cosmetic if it improves how people think and work inside the system. “Chapter/day terminology, page templates, knot retirement” suggests the notebook is being simplified and made more usable. Better structure usually leads to better operating discipline: less confusion, more consistent entries, and easier onboarding for future users or collaborators. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

Finally, the two **work-cici / Cici handoff** documentation commits indicate that Grace-Mar is not being built in isolation; it is starting to function as a source of transferable operating discipline for adjacent systems. That is strategically significant because it suggests Grace-Mar is maturing from a single internal repo into a model that can shape how other AI-driven projects are governed. In business terms, this raises its value from “tool” toward “operating pattern.” ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))

**Bottom line:** these changes matter because Grace-Mar is becoming more trustworthy, more modular, and more governable. The repo is not merely getting more capable; it is becoming better at controlling capability. That is the real strategic value. More output alone is cheap in the AI era. A system that can reliably produce useful work **and** explain, constrain, and audit that work is much rarer—and much more valuable. ([GitHub](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar/commits/main))
