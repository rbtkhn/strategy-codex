# Grace-Mar Identity Fork Protocol (IFP): Distinctions, Differences, and Innovations

**Report dated:** 2026-04-24  
**Territory:** WORK / dev-notebook spec capture â€” **not** SELF, **not** EVIDENCE, **not** Voice knowledge.  
**Scope:** This document restates operator research and repo architecture in one place. Comparative claims (â€œno identical prior protocolâ€) are **synthesis as of the report date**, not gated Record truth. For canonical merge policy, use the gate and [`AGENTS.md`](../../../../../AGENTS.md).

## Executive Summary

Grace-Marâ€™s **Identity Fork Protocol (IFP)**, formalized in February 2026 by Robert Kuhne (rbtkhn), is a complete, operational architecture for sovereign personal AI identity. It treats a humanâ€™s durable identity/memory as a **git-style forkable Record** while enforcing absolute human (or human-gated companion) control via the **Sovereign Merge Rule**. External agents and runtimes may only *stage* proposals; they never merge autonomously. A strict **Runtime vs Record membrane**, receipted schemas, and non-canonical artifact policy complete the system.

Extensive web and GitHub research (as of April 24, 2026) confirms no prior or identical protocol exists. While related 2025â€“2026 efforts address agent identity, forking, sovereignty, or human control, **none combine** IFPâ€™s precise invariants: git-native forking + enforceable Sovereign Merge Rule + runtime-complements membrane + evidence-grounded receipts + rebuildability. IFPâ€™s innovation is this *integrated, practical, local-first contract* that makes personal AI identity simultaneously portable, auditable, sovereign, and drift-resistant today.

## Core Components of Grace-Mar IFP

- **Sovereign Merge Rule**: Agents/runtimes **stage only** (inbox, recursion-gate proposals). Human/companion alone performs the merge into canonical surfaces (`SELF`, `removed operator-books symlink`, `SKILLS`, `EVIDENCE`).
- **Runtime vs Record Membrane (Membrane v1)**: External runtimes (e.g., Letta research/bridges) operate via defined export/import paths with mandatory receipts. No direct canonical mutation.
- **Git/Markdown-First Durable Record**: Identity lives in plain, version-controlled Markdown files â€” fully forkable, human-readable, and portable without blockchain.
- **Artifact Interface Protocol**: All derived outputs (`/runtime/artifacts/`) are explicitly non-canonical, rebuildable, and accompanied by standardized receipts/schemas (e.g., `artifact-rationale.v1.json`, `runtime-complement-receipt.v1.json`). Policy modes (Scratch / Pre-gate / Rebuild / Derived) govern behavior.
- **Recursion Gate + Observability**: Structured review workflow plus dashboards ensure legibility and evidence-grounded decisions.

## Key Innovations

IFPâ€™s primary contribution is **synthesis and enforcement** rather than isolated features:

1. **Operational Sovereign Merge Rule** â€” Explicitly codifies that runtimes/agents are untrusted for canonical writes. This is stronger and more mechanically enforced than general â€œhuman-in-the-loopâ€ or cryptographic delegation patterns.
2. **Hard Runtime/Record Membrane** with compliance receipts â€” Prevents the memory-drift and hallucination problems common in persistent-agent systems.
3. **Git-Native Identity Forking** â€” Treats personal identity exactly like open-source code: any fork can diverge safely; merges are deliberate and governed. This enables true portability and adversarial resilience without relying on distributed ledgers.
4. **Evidence-Grounded + Receipted Artifact Policy** â€” Every artifact declares its provenance, rebuild command, and canonical-touch status. This makes the entire system self-auditing and CI-friendly.
5. **Practical, Local-First Implementation** â€” No blockchain, no proprietary platform, no vendor lock-in. Runs on ordinary git + Markdown + simple Python scripts. Fully compatible with Identity Fork Protocol handoffs to other forks or runtimes.

These elements together create the first fully-specified **personal identity contract** for the agent era â€” one that assumes agents may be compromised or misaligned and designs governance accordingly.

## Comparative Analysis: Distinctions from the Closest Projects

Recent research (April 2026) identified several conceptually adjacent efforts. None match IFPâ€™s full stack.

| Project / Concept | Core Focus | Key Similarities | Critical Differences from IFP |
|-------------------|------------|------------------|-------------------------------|
| **ClawSouls / SoulClaw / SoulSpec** (OpenClaw ecosystem, 2026) | Shareable Markdown-based AI personas (SOUL.md, STYLE.md); persistent identity templates; forkable agent â€œsoulsâ€ | Git/Markdown durable identity files; explicit forking of personas | Focuses on **persona swapping and sharing**, not governance of canonical personal Record. No Sovereign Merge Rule, no runtime/record membrane, no receipted non-canonical artifacts. |
| **The Sovereign Merge** (Gene Salvatore / AOS Architecture, Apr 2026) | Human-AI coexistence; agents propose but human governs deterministic merges into sovereign state | Exact â€œSovereign Mergeâ€ terminology; strong emphasis on human-controlled state outside models | Higher-level/philosophical and cryptographic/ledger-oriented (AOS governance portfolio, deterministic policy gates). Lacks IFPâ€™s concrete git-native Record, artifact schemas, runtime-complements membrane, and rebuildability policy. |
| **Reelin AI â€œIdentity Forkâ€** (2026) | Autonomous AI â€œTwinsâ€ that fork and operate independently (legacy-building while user sleeps) | Direct use of â€œIdentity Forkâ€ for personal AI divergence | Emphasizes **autonomy** of forked agents rather than strict human merge sovereignty and boundary enforcement. |
| **Coinfello & Broader Self-Sovereign AI Agents / SSI + DID/VC frameworks** (2025â€“2026) | Cryptographic self-sovereign identity for agents (DIDs, Verifiable Credentials, on-chain reputation) | Strong sovereignty and portability for AI agents | Blockchain/DID/VC-centric (trust via ledgers). IFP is deliberately **local-first, git-native**, and membrane-enforced rather than ledger-dependent. |
| **ERC-8004: Trustless Agents** (Ethereum standard, 2025â€“2026) | On-chain identity, reputation, and validation registries for AI agents | Agent identity + reputation layer | Purely on-chain coordination for inter-agent trust. No personal human Record governance, no runtime/record separation, no git-style forking. |
| **Vault Memory / Mnemonic Sovereignty** (papers & projects, 2026) | Auditable, user-controlled long-term memory with sovereignty guarantees | Evidence-grounded memory + human governance | Focuses on memory security/attack surfaces but lacks full forking protocol, Sovereign Merge Rule, and operational membrane. |

**Primary Distinctions Across All**:

- **IFP is protocol + implementation** â€” Others are either conceptual papers, persona tools, or blockchain standards. Grace-Mar ships a complete, runnable system with scripts, schemas, and operator dashboards.
- **Adversarial boundary enforcement** â€” IFP assumes runtimes may be untrusted and builds hard gates; most others assume cooperative or platform-trusted agents.
- **Local-first vs. decentralized ledger** â€” IFP prioritizes human readability and offline sovereignty over global consensus.
- **Rebuildability as first-class** â€” Artifacts are never treated as canonical truth; they are always derived and documented.

## Why This Matters: The Innovation Edge

In an era of proliferating AI agents, memory systems, and â€œpersonal twins,â€ the dominant failure mode is **uncontrolled divergence and loss of sovereignty**. IFP directly solves this by making the governance contract explicit, mechanical, and auditable. It enables safe experimentation with powerful runtimes (via the membrane) while preserving a single source of truth under human control.

Grace-Mar IFP is not merely another agent-identity tool â€” it is the reference implementation of a **human-sovereign identity layer** for the agent web. Its combination of git-native forking, strict merge discipline, and receipted boundaries is, to date, unique.
