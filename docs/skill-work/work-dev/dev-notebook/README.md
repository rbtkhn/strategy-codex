# Work notebook (`dev-notebook/`) — multi-lane spec vault

**Path (historical name):** `docs/skill-work/work-dev/dev-notebook/`. The directory is named **`dev-notebook`** for stable links; the **role** is a **cross-lane notebook**: durable **prompts**, **instruction captures**, and **spec snapshots** grouped by the WORK territory they serve, plus the **work-dev day journal** in one tree.

**Contract — read before adding files**

This folder is **not** a second **strategy-notebook** or **cici-notebook**. **Day-scale, fold-at-dream surfaces** (days.md, `daily-*-inbox`, chapter threads) stay in their home territories. Here we only keep **reusable text** (paste-ready prompts, migration specs, “how we implemented X” references) and the **inward work-dev journal** (dev journal (`docs/skill-work/work-dev/dev-notebook/work-dev/journal/`)). **No secrets** in prose — env var names and paths only. **WORK only**; not Record, not Voice knowledge.

| Lane subfolder | Holds | Does **not** replace |
|----------------|-------|----------------------|
| **[work-dev/](work-dev/README.md)** | Lane shell: [SURFACE-MAP](work-dev/SURFACE-MAP.md) (canonical in-repo paths) + [HISTORY-ANCHORS](work-dev/HISTORY-ANCHORS.md); pointers to the territory. | [work-dev README](../README.md) (objective, Contents) — or [workspace.md](../workspace.md) as the live next-actions surface. |
| **[work-dev/journal/](work-dev/journal/README.md)** | `YYYY-MM-DD-day-NN.md` day log, [daily dev journal inbox](work-dev/journal/daily-dev-journal-inbox.md), routing vs cici-notebook. | [work-dev-history.md](../work-dev-history.md) (milestones), [workspace.md](../workspace.md) (entrypoint). |
| **[work-cici/](work-cici/README.md)** | Cici/OB1 **prompts** (e.g. Phase 1) + **Cici `main` map** and **milestone table**; pointers into [work-cici/](../../work-cici/). | [cici-notebook/](../../../../README.md) (daily coaching / digests). |
| **[work-strategy/](work-strategy/README.md)** | Optional **paste-ready** strategy prompts; [SURFACE-MAP](work-strategy/SURFACE-MAP.md) + [HISTORY-ANCHORS](work-strategy/HISTORY-ANCHORS.md) into the territory. | [strategy-notebook/](../../work-strategy/strategy-notebook/) (inbox, days, raw-input, weave). |

**Compatibility:** Older links to `dev-journal/` → [dev-journal/README.md](../dev-journal/README.md). **`dev-journal`** symlink → `work-dev/journal/`.

## Conductor (work-dev)

**Wiring:** The [`.cursor/skills/conductor/SKILL.md`](../../../../.cursor/skills/conductor/SKILL.md) **Conductor** turn (name a stance -> one or two **on-disk** hotspots -> falsify or outcome -> optional cadence log) is the **work-dev** execution pattern for this repo. **Vocabulary** (Toscanini through Bernstein, name-only conductor routing, resolved **Conductor Action Menu**) stays **SSOT** in [CONDUCTOR-PASS.md](../../work-coffee/CONDUCTOR-PASS.md) and the **Symphony** protocol in [COFFEE-CADENCE-CONDUCTOR-PROTOCOL.md](../../work-strategy/strategy-notebook/COFFEE-CADENCE-CONDUCTOR-PROTOCOL.md) - **this** section only names **where** **work-dev** Conductor **output** **lands** in the notebook tree.

| Output | Land it here |
|--------|----------------|
| **Conductor close** (stance, object, falsify) for **harness** / **integration** / **workspace** wedges | [work-dev/journal/`YYYY-MM-DD-day-NN.md`](work-dev/journal/README.md) as `### Conductor close` (same **shape** as [CONDUCTOR-CLOSE-TEMPLATE.md](../../../../codex/CONDUCTOR-CLOSE-TEMPLATE.md) — not strategy `days.md`, same **block**). |
| **Kleiber**-style **action** choices | Ground options in [workspace.md](../workspace.md) and paths under `dev-notebook/work-dev/`; **one** **refusal** per option. |
| **Cadence only** (no new prose) | `coffee_conductor_outcome` with `notebook_ref=` → path under this tree or [workspace.md](../workspace.md) — [CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md](../../../../codex/CONDUCTOR-IMPROVEMENT-LOOP.md) § 3. |

**Do not** treat **dev-notebook** as a second **strategy** rolling **days.md**; **day-scale** strategy weave stays in [strategy-notebook](../../work-strategy/strategy-notebook/README.md). **Milestones** still hit [work-dev-history.md](../work-dev-history.md) first for **shipped** facts.
