# Verification run - 2026-05-01

## Command or procedure

- `python scripts/build_memory_observability.py -u grace-mar --quiet-ok`
- `python -m pytest tests/test_memory_observability.py -p no:cacheprovider --basetemp=pytest-tmp-memory-hardening`
- `python scripts/validate_skills.py`

## Result

- The memory observability report rebuilt under `runtime/artifacts/memory/`.
- The focused tests cover cadence parsing, status classification, markdown rendering, JSON shape, compact one-line formatting, and static coffee/dream one-line wiring.
- Coffee and dream remain non-blocking surfaces: they may print one `Memory observability:` line when the derived report is not `ok`; they do not paste the full dashboard and do not edit MEMORY, Record, or gate files.

## Judgment

Memory observability matters because continuity risk should be felt at the moment of operator routing, not discovered later as a stale hidden report.

## Environment

- Workspace: `grace-mar`
- User: `grace-mar`
- Scope: WORK-derived observability only
