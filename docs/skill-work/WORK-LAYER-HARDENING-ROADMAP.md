# Work-layer hardening roadmap (grace-mar)

**Purpose:** Single **dependency order** for bringing WORK lanes closer to Record-adjacent discipline **without** changing companion merge authority. **Not** Record truth.

**Authority:** Promoted watches, decision recommendations, and lane metrics are **WORK artifacts**. **SELF / EVIDENCE / prompt** change only through **RECURSION-GATE** and companion approval ([AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md)).

## Recommended sequence
