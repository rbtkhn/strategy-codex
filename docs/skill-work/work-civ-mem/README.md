# work-civ-mem

**Objective:** Manage and improve the `civilization_memory` repository from Grace-Mar as a bounded stewardship territory: audit drift, maintain workflow clarity, prepare contributions, and keep repo-management work aligned with the broader Companion Self product strategy.

`civilization_memory` is a separate repository and canon for civilizational history, strategy, governance, and tooling. `work-civ-mem` is Grace-Mar's management surface for that repository, not a replacement for its internal `STATE` / `SCHOLAR` operating modes.

---

## Purpose

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Repository stewardship** | Track the health, structure, validation surfaces, and maintenance needs of `civilization_memory`. |
| **Audit and drift detection** | Identify governance drift, stale docs, broken workflows, or repo-management gaps before they accumulate. |
| **Contribution preparation** | Prepare bounded fixes, doc updates, workflow notes, and future patches for the `civilization_memory` repo. |
| **Strategic alignment** | Keep CMC repo-management work legible inside Grace-Mar while capturing adjacent Companion Self product priorities without mixing them into CMC scope. |

---

## Boundary

This territory distinguishes three things clearly:

1. **`civilization_memory`** — the managed external repository and canonical CMC system.
2. **`work-civ-mem`** — Grace-Mar's stewardship territory for managing that repository.
3. **Companion Self product priorities** — adjacent strategic concerns that may inform the roadmap, but are not owned by CMC and are not part of this territory's first-pass implementation.

So `work-civ-mem` is about **repository management**, not about importing CMC operations into Grace-Mar, not about turning Grace-Mar into a `STATE` / `SCHOLAR` console, and not about collapsing product strategy into civilizational analysis.

---

## Topic routing (strategy lane)

For **multi-region** questions (papacy, Latin Europe, Americas Catholic history, Islam–Christian encounter), see **[TOPIC-ROUTING.md](TOPIC-ROUTING.md)** and `scripts/route_civ_mem_topic.py` — profiles in `config/civ_mem_topic_routes.yaml` prioritize **ROME** and MEM **CONNECTIONS** expansion before ad hoc search. Optional **routing focus** (`config/civ_mem_routing_focus.yaml`, `scripts/suggest_routing_focus.py`) adds time-bounded overlap bonuses from recent routing logs.

Trace governance for this lane is defined in **[topic-trace-contract.md](topic-trace-contract.md)**: CIV-MEM topic tracing is **WORK · DERIVED · NOT RECORD**, upstream is read-only, and structural analogy is not truth validation. Use **[topic-trace-template.md](topic-trace-template.md)** as the standard reusable skeleton when producing a derived topic-trace file in Grace-Mar (frontmatter + sections; governed by the contract, not a duplicate of it).

## How CMC Is Useful Inside Grace-Mar

Civilization memory has **no monetary purpose**. Its purpose is **pure understanding of history**, which can help leaders’ wisdom. Inside Grace-Mar it functions as an **external civilizational reference surface**, not as part of the companion's Record. It can support lookup, curriculum design, historical explanation, strategic analogy, and work territories that need deeper structured context about civilizations, institutions, continuity, and decline. Grace-Mar may consult it when civilizational context helps the companion think, learn, plan, or build, but nothing from `civilization_memory` becomes Grace-Mar's personal knowledge unless it is explicitly surfaced and approved through the normal gate. In this way, `civilization_memory` functions as a high-quality external corpus and thinking aid, while the Record remains companion-specific, evidence-linked, and sovereign.

### Typical useful scenarios

- **History lookup** — structured reference for Rome, China, dynasties, empires, pharaohs, and other civilizational topics
- **Curriculum design** — source material for `work-alpha-school` history sequencing, reading paths, or comparison units
- **Strategic analogy** — external historical context for institutional, political, or civilizational pattern analysis
- **Work support** — input for `work-civ-mem`, `work-politics`, operator research, and strategy writing  
  - work-politics: [civ-mem-draft-protocol.md](../work-politics/civ-mem-draft-protocol.md) (human-always-approves on any ship)
  - work-jiang: [CIV-MEM-LENS.md](../../codex/predictive-history/CIV-MEM-LENS.md) — lattice for lecture analysis + registries (reference only; not Record)
- **Library and canon support** — a return-to reference source inside `self-library`

### Safe vs unsafe boundary

**Safe uses:**
- external lookup source
- curriculum and reading-path support
- structured historical input for work territories
- source of questions, analogies, and explanatory context

**Unsafe uses:**
- treating CMC content as Grace-Mar's personal knowledge by default
- merging CMC facts directly into `IX-A` without explicit engagement and approval
- letting CMC silently redefine the companion's worldview or the Voice's undocumented knowledge
- confusing external civilizational corpus with internal documented self

Compressed rule: `civilization_memory` is a reference corpus and work aid, not part of Grace-Mar's personal Record by default.

## Principles

1. **Repository, not Record** — `civilization_memory` is a managed external repo/project, not part of Grace-Mar's Record.
2. **Human-gated stewardship** — Grace-Mar may read, analyze, draft, and prepare contributions, but upstream changes remain human-approved.
3. **Preserve CMC governance** — No silent reinterpretation of CMC modes, doctrines, or internal rules from the Grace-Mar side.
4. **No mixed-scope drift** — Keep repo management, civilizational operations, and Companion Self product strategy distinct.
5. **Auditability first** — Track repo-management work through explicit docs, reports, and future contribution surfaces rather than ad hoc memory.
6. **Future leverage stays explicit** — Adjacent product priorities may be recorded in the roadmap, but they are not implied commitments for this territory's first pass.

## Risk mitigation (template — Tier 1+)

Per [work-template/README.md](../work-template/README.md) § *Risk-mitigation checklist*. Filled for **external-repo stewardship** — `civilization_memory` stays upstream-governed; Grace-Mar prepares, not replaces, CMC canon.

### 1. Quantitative success criteria

| Metric | Target | How to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Contribution hygiene | Prepared patches pass **upstream** validation before open PR | `tools/cmc-governance-checks.sh`, `cmc-validate-corpus.py`, index build — see [Repo Touchpoints](#repo-touchpoints) |
| Drift visibility | [audit-report.md](audit-report.md) and [workspace.md](workspace.md) do not silently contradict each other on “what’s broken” | Occasional diff between audit snapshot and runbook; reopen audit when repo structure shifts |
| Record boundary | **Zero** merges of CMC prose into `IX-A` / Voice as default knowledge | [§ Safe vs unsafe](#safe-vs-unsafe-boundary); political ship stays [civ-mem-draft-protocol.md](../work-politics/civ-mem-draft-protocol.md) |

### 2. Sustainment table

| Task | Cadence | What to check |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Validation loop | On change to managed paths or before upstream PR | Commands in [workspace.md](workspace.md) still match repo `README` / `tools/` |
| Roadmap honesty | Quarterly or when roadmap assumptions change | [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) phased claims vs actual automation shipped |
| Routing / scripts | When `config/civ_mem_*.yaml` or routers change | [TOPIC-ROUTING.md](TOPIC-ROUTING.md) + `route_civ_mem_topic.py` smoke still match operator paths |

### 3. Deprecation / retirement path

1. **Stop active stewardship** of the fork/workspace — companion decision; document in [workspace.md](workspace.md) or this README (one “last reviewed / status” line).
2. Close open **prepared contribution** notes with explicit **wontfix** or **upstream superseded** — no ghost tickets.
3. Archive Grace-Mar-only stewardship memos under dated pointers; preserve the civ-mem provenance note in `research/repos/civilization_memory/STRATEGY-CODEX-PROVENANCE.md` when the local snapshot is refreshed or retired.
4. Remove or narrow automation (`scripts/` bridges) only after nothing depends on them; the local snapshot is the working corpus here, while upstream remains a historical reference for provenance and manual refresh.

### 4. Scope creep guardrail

> Any workflow that **imports CMC operating modes (STATE/SCHOLAR)** into Grace-Mar as **live control surfaces**, **merges civilizational claims into the Record without the gate**, or **folds Companion Self product roadmaps into CMC obligations** requires a **new plan** — not an incremental README edit. This lane’s charter is **stewardship + bounded contributions**; **sovereignty and Record stay Grace-Mar-governed**, **canon stays `civilization_memory`-governed**.
