# work-dream

**Purpose:** Operator-facing doctrine, boundaries, and evolution history for Grace-Mar's `dream` ritual â€” the end-of-day consolidation pass. The executable trigger surface lives in [.cursor/skills/dream/SKILL.md](../../../.cursor/skills/dream/SKILL.md).

**Not** Record truth. **Not** MEMORY. **Not** a second merge path.

---

## Role

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Consolidation architecture** | Defines the shape of end-of-day maintenance: memory normalization, integrity, governance, contradiction digest, artifact drafts. |
| **Night-to-morning handoff** | Documents the `last-dream.json` data contract that bridges dream output to coffee Step 1. |
| **Strategy notebook (strategy-codex (`codex/`))** | **`dream` does not** own notebook production. Fold runs in **`strategy`** or on explicit **fold**; `auto_dream.py` may report **`strategy_notebook_missing_day_headers`** as optional FYI. See [STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../codex/STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md) Â§ *Entry model* and [.cursor/skills/dream/SKILL.md](../../../.cursor/skills/dream/SKILL.md) Â§ *Strategy notebook*. |
| **Cici notebook (cici notebook (`singularity/work-cici/cici-notebook/`))** | Dream **initiates generation** of the calendar dayâ€™s [`cici-notebook`](../../../singularity/work-cici/cici-notebook/) file via [`cici_journal_ob1_digest.py`](../../../scripts/cici_journal_ob1_digest.py) `--write` (GitHub network; optional token). Not her Record; WORK lane. See dream SKILL Â§ *Cici notebook*. |
| **Boundary surface** | Explains what belongs in WORK-only docs/history versus what must escalate to `RECURSION-GATE`. |
| **Choreography with coffee** | Holds the rationale for the dreamâ†’coffee pairing: sequence, timing, data flow. |

## Relationship to `dream`

| Layer | Role |
|-------|------|
| **[`.cursor/skills/dream/SKILL.md`](../../../.cursor/skills/dream/SKILL.md)** | Executable contract: triggers, Step 0 rhythm depth, `auto_dream.py`, night-close reply shape, guardrails. |
| **`work-dream/` (this doc)** | Doctrine, boundaries, history â€” read when evolving the ritual, not for every run. |
| **Scripts** | `scripts/auto_dream.py`, `last-dream.json` â€” machine handoff; not Record. |

**Cadence alignment:** Step 0 line counts for dream live in [work-cadence README â€” Step 0 recent rhythm](../work-cadence/README.md#step-0-recent-rhythm-companion-facing) (dream = **4 default / 8 full closeout**).

**Simplified return contract:** Night-close chat uses a **short default brief** (Recent rhythm, run status, closing sentence) plus optional **Details** only when load-bearing. **`tomorrow_inherits`** is the primary human â€œtomorrowâ€ hint; execution-path / coffee letter is secondary. See the skill â€” *Step 0*, *What to return*, *Five-second closeout*, *When `--strict` halts*.

This split mirrors `work-coffee`: the skill stays optimized for invocation; this territory holds longer-form doctrine and history.

## Gate threshold

`work-dream` is **WORK-only by default**.

Keep changes in docs/history only when they are about:

- maintenance semantics (what dream checks, in what order)
- strict mode behavior and when to use it
- handoff contract shape (`last-dream.json` fields)
- contradiction digest integration
- dreamâ†’coffee choreography

Stage to **`recursion-gate.md`** only when a `work-dream` insight would change governed behavior, such as:

- durable prompt or policy behavior
- changes to how integrity/governance checks affect the Record
- new artifact types that cross into Record territory

This territory never creates a second merge path. `RECURSION-GATE` remains the membrane.

## Script topology

```
auto_dream.py
  â”œâ”€ dream_catchup.py              since-previous-dream window + strategy-notebook gap list
  â”œâ”€ maintain_self_memory()        normalize memory.md
  â”œâ”€ validate-integrity.py         integrity checks (--json)
  â”œâ”€ governance_checker.py         governance scan
  â”œâ”€ contradiction_digest.py       derived contradiction digest
  â”‚    â””â”€ write_artifact_drafts()  optional artifact drafts
  â”œâ”€ platform/config/context_budgets/dream.json   write-path caps (via context_budget.py)
  â”œâ”€ emit_pipeline_event.py        maintenance event
  â””â”€ _write_last_dream_handoff()   writes last-dream.json (includes dream_catchup when ok)
operator_daily_warmup.py           reads coffee.json for collapsed Last dream display
audit_context_tax.py               approximate ritual paste line/char counts

Strategy notebook (work-strategy) â€” not a subprocess inside auto_dream.py; use
`dream_catchup` from `--json` / `last-dream.json` for local dates + missing `##` headers; agent stubs per dream SKILL.

Cici notebook (work-cici) â€” `cici_journal_ob1_digest.py --catch-up-from-last-dream --write` (network); same date window as `dream_catchup`.
```

**Bundle:** `operator_end_of_day.py` runs `auto_dream.py` then `operator_handoff_check.py` â€” night-side counterpart to `operator_reentry_stack.py`.

**Strict mode:** `--strict` tightens integrity parity, contradiction classification, and failure states. Same ritual, sharper posture. Use at end of week or after unusual maintenance events.

## Handoff contract

`last-dream.json` (written to ``) contains:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `generated_at` | ISO timestamp | When dream ran |
| `ok` | boolean | Overall pass/fail |
| `integrity_ok` | boolean | Integrity check result |
| `governance_ok` | boolean | Governance check result |
| `self_memory_changed` | boolean | Whether memory was normalized |
| `reviewable_count` | int | Reviewable items in contradiction digest |
| `contradiction_count` | int | Contradictions found |
| `artifact_draft_count` | int | Artifact drafts generated |
| `promotable_draft_count` | int | Drafts ready for promotion |
| `followups` | string[] | Human-readable follow-up items for morning |
| `coffee_rollup_24h` | object | Rolling 24h summary of `coffee` lines from [`work-cadence-events.md`](../work-cadence/work-cadence-events.md) (`count`, `by_mode`, `by_picked`, `picks`, `first_ts`, `last_ts`, `runs`, â€¦) |
| `conductor_rollup_24h` | object | Rolling 24h summary of Conductor `coffee_pick conductor=...` and `coffee_conductor_outcome` lines. Includes `last_master`, `completed_passes`, `orientation_only`, `off_menu_refusals`, `notebook_ref_count`, `falsify_count`, `open_arcs`, recent closes / commits / falsifiers, and one compact `echo` for morning coffee. WORK telemetry only; not Record. |
| `execution_paths` | object[] | Three deterministic morning paths (`today_field`, `build`, `steward`) with `first_move`, `stop_rule`, `signals_used` |
| `suggested_execution_path_index` | int | 0â€“2; **Steward (2)** if integrity or governance failed this run, else **Steward** if gate pending > `max_pending_candidates` in `platform/config/fork-config.json`, else **calendar** `(tomorrow_tm_yday - 1) % 3` |
| `execution_path_suggestion_reason` | string | `integrity_or_governance_fail` \| `gate_backlog` \| `calendar_mod3` |
| `tomorrow_inherits` | string | One-line operational hint for morning (not policy or Record) |
| `civmem_echoes` | object[] | Token-overlap hits from in-repo [`docs/civilization-memory/`](../../civilization-memory/README.md) (count capped by `platform/config/context_budgets/dream.json`); each echo includes `analogy_label`, optional `specificity_pass`, `score` |
| `civmem_disclaimer` | string | States analogical / non-Record scope |
| `civmem_index_missing` | boolean | True when the in-repo civ-mem index file is absent |
| `civmem_suppressed_reason` | string | Present when echoes were cleared by budget or checks (e.g. `disabled_by_budget`, `suppressed_integrity_fail`, `suppressed_governance_alert`) |
| `frontier_source_hint` | object | Metadata-only AI frontier watch from The Innermost Loop RSS (`title`, `url`, `published_at`, `status`, `source_mode=live_lookup`). Dream does not store the post body, generate a summary, create raw-input, or compose strategy from it. |

**Civ-mem query source:** Echoes are computed from the **pre-persist** memory snapshot used in the same `auto_dream` run (`memory_result.before`), which can differ from on-disk `memory.md` after normalization writes in that run.

**Context budgets:** Write-path caps and suppress rules live in [`platform/config/context_budgets/dream.json`](../../../platform/config/context_budgets/dream.json); display defaults for the collapsed Last dream block live in [`platform/config/context_budgets/coffee.json`](../../../platform/config/context_budgets/coffee.json). See [`platform/config/context_budgets/README.md`](../../../platform/config/context_budgets/README.md).

**Doctrine:** Dream suggestions (paths, civ-mem, rollup) are **operational hints only** â€” not truth, not priority, not a substitute for gate review, integrity, companion approval, or operator judgment. Cadence artifacts are not a shadow Record.

**AI frontier watch:** Dream may read the latest The Innermost Loop RSS metadata and carry it into `frontier_source_hint` / `followups` as a next-day watch signal. This is deliberately metadata-only. If the post looks strategically important, the next-day route is Coffee C / strategy source hygiene, where raw-input or source-pack treatment can happen explicitly.

**Conductor compression:** Dream may compress the day's Conductor passes into `conductor_rollup_24h`, then coffee may render one **Conductor echo** line. This is deliberately compression, not continuation: dream does not generate fresh Conductor options, does not auto-compose notebooks, and treats off-menu/no-action outcomes as parked/refused telemetry rather than as a fourth choice.

Clients should **ignore unknown keys** on future dream versions.

Coffee Step 1 (`operator_daily_warmup.py`) reads this file and renders a **collapsed** **"Last dream (night handoff)"** block by default (`--verbose-dream` for full detail; `--show-civ-mem` / `--show-rollup` opt into extra collapsed lines; defaults from `coffee.json`). The file is classified as runtime noise in `operator_handoff_check.py` â€” it does not need to be committed.

**Strict halt:** When `auto_dream.py --strict` stops early on integrity/governance failure, a new `last-dream.json` may not be written; morning pickup can reflect an older handoff until the next successful run.

## Continuity and trail

`work-dream` does **not** replace any existing continuity surface.

- **Raw continuity:** `session-transcript.md`
- **Lane breadcrumbs:** `docs/skill-work/work-dream/work-dream-history.md`
- **Optional continuity memory:** `memory.md`
- **Governed durable changes:** `recursion-gate.md`

## Scope boundaries

In scope:

- end-of-day consolidation architecture
- maintenance semantics and strict mode
- contradiction digest integration
- handoff contract design
- dreamâ†’coffee choreography
- night-side operator ergonomics

Out of scope:

- morning re-entry or orientation (that's coffee)
- Record merges or prompt edits without the gate
- generic repo hygiene (coffee B / handoff-check)
- work-politics or other territory content
