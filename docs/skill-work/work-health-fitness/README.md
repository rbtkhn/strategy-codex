# work-health-fitness

**Digital trainer.** work-health-fitness is a multi-user health and fitness support layer: it can handle multiple users, each with their own profile (growth baseline, preferences, goals). The trainer supports â€” sleep, movement, nutrition, recovery â€” in a companion-led way: it offers structure and prompts; it does not prescribe.

**Current users:** Abigail (Abby), Hannah. Profiles live in ``: `health-fitness-profile.md` (Abigail), `health-fitness-profile-hannah.md` (Hannah).

## Purpose

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Digital trainer** | One capability layer serving multiple users. Per-user profiles (identity, growth baseline, preferences) inform prompts, wisdom questions, and optional lesson/checkpoint integration. |
| **User-led** | Each user (or their caregiver) sets goals and pacing. The trainer supports; it does not compel. Meet where they are (AGENTS rule 7). |

work-health-fitness does not prescribe; it offers structure and prompts that each user can adopt, adapt, or ignore.

## Principles

1. **Meet each user where they are** â€” No pushing through resistance. If a user deflects or shows resistance, respect the boundary. (AGENTS rule 7.)
2. **User-led** â€” Health and fitness goals, pacing, and activities are set by the user (or caregiver). The trainer supports; it does not compel.
3. **Evidence-based** â€” When the trainer or Voice offers suggestions, base them on that user's documented profile (preferences, growth baseline) or on safe, general principles. Calibrated abstention when outside knowledge.
4. **Integrate with existing flows** â€” Health/fitness can be woven into lesson prompts, wisdom questions, or checkpoint reflections when the user consents.
