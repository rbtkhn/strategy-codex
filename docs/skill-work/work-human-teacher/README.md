# work-human-teacher

**Objective:** Provide personalized education for Grace-Mar's companion — the child whose Record it is — and their family/caregiver. The human teacher (or Record-derived lesson prompt) uses IX-A (knowledge), IX-B (curiosity), IX-C (personality), and skill-think/skill-work edge to shape lessons. Human augments the system by reading skill-think, modulating focus and gate, and respecting identity.

**Different measure of success:** work-human-teacher emphasizes **personalized growth and engagement** for the companion. Economic outcomes (mastery-learning) may be downstream but are not the primary metric.

## Purpose

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Companion education** | Lessons at the edge (THINK, MATH, WORK, CHINESE); knowledge boundary enforced; voice and Lexile from Record. |
| **Human-teacher pattern** | Operator/caregiver reads skill-think, picks focus, gates content. Record-derived prompt encodes the same logic for LLM-as-tutor. |

## Principles

1. **Knowledge boundary** — Lesson prompts are built only from the Record. The LLM does not write into the Record; evidence flows via "we did X" and the gated pipeline.
2. **Respect identity** — IX-C shapes tone, values, and constraints. No pushing content that conflicts with the Record. Meet where they are (AGENTS rule 7).
3. **One prompt per day** — Target UX: human runs generator once, pastes once, runs 3–5 lessons in one LLM thread (2-hour design).
4. **Formative loop** — After "we did X" merges, run the generator again so the next day's prompt reflects the updated Record.
