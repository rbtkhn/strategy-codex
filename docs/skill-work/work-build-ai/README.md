# work-build-ai

**→ Merged into [work-dev](../work-dev/README.md).** This folder is kept for legacy links; canonical content and operator entrypoint live in **work-dev**.

---

**Objective:** Connect Grace-Mar (Record + Voice) with OpenClaw (personal agent workspace) so the Record feeds OpenClaw's identity layer, session continuity spans both systems, and OpenClaw artifacts can feed the grace-mar pipeline — with the companion always as gate.

---

## Purpose

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Record as identity source** | Export **SELF** (Record) → OpenClaw `user.md` or `SOUL.md` (their filenames) so the agent has the companion **self** / identity layer. Constitution prefix from INTENT. |
| **Session continuity** | OpenClaw reads SESSION-LOG, RECURSION-GATE, EVIDENCE before starting work. |
| **Artifacts as evidence** | OpenClaw outputs → "we did X" → pipeline. User invokes; operator stages; companion approves. |
| **Staging automation** | OpenClaw skill/cron can stage to RECURSION-GATE. Stage only; never merge. |

**Invariant:** The companion is always the gate. OpenClaw can stage; it cannot merge into the Record. This is non-negotiable: OpenClaw or downstream systems must never become control-grid infrastructure that centralizes identity or removes human approval. Companion sovereignty over the Record is preserved regardless of integration depth.

**Comprehension lock-in:** Enterprise stacks are racing to host *synthesis* (who-knows-what-across-systems) inside vendor runtimes — understanding that does not export cleanly. Grace-Mar’s counter at companion scale: **approved Record + export** (USER.md, PRP, manifest) so identity and documented understanding stay **portable** and **gate-kept**, not trapped in one agent’s memory. See [design-notes §2.5](../../design-notes.md#25-control-grid-vs-grace-mar--sovereignty-as-positioning) and [implementable-insights §10](../../implementable-insights.md#10-comprehension-lock-in-vs-companion-owned-synthesis).

## Principles

1. **Companion sovereignty** — Merge authority stays with the companion. OpenClaw stages; companion approves.
2. **Knowledge boundary** — Voice responses use only what is documented in the Record. No LLM inference into identity facts.
3. **Stage-only automation** — OpenClaw skills may read, analyze, and stage candidates. They may not merge into SELF, EVIDENCE, or prompt.
4. **Session continuity** — When running shared workspace, read SESSION-LOG, RECURSION-GATE, and recent EVIDENCE before starting. Keep the loop closed.
5. **Handback provenance** — Inbound staging includes advisory constitutional check against INTENT; events emitted for audit.
6. **Portable synthesis** — Merge-approved truth in-repo; refresh exports after merges so OpenClaw never becomes the only place “who the companion is” lives.
7. **Agent reliability** — Do not treat chain-of-thought or internal traces as audit. For consequential agent work outside the companion Voice, use **tail scenarios**, **factorial variations**, and **deterministic checks** (see [agent-reliability-playbook.md](agent-reliability-playbook.md)).

## Quick Reference

**Export identity:**
```bash
python platform/integrations/openclaw_hook.py --user grace-mar --format md+manifest --emit-event
```

**Handback (stage only):**
```bash
python platform/integrations/openclaw_stage.py --user grace-mar --text "we explored X in OpenClaw"
python platform/integrations/openclaw_stage.py --user grace-mar --artifact ./outputs/session-note.md
```

## Operator path

Use this order when actively working on the territory:

1. Open [workspace.md](workspace.md) for the current state and canonical file map.
2. Check [integration-status.md](integration-status.md) before assuming a capability is operational.
3. Read [known-gaps.md](known-gaps.md) before claiming provenance, benchmark, or continuity coverage.
4. Use [provenance-checklist.md](provenance-checklist.md) when validating export or handback behavior.
5. Use [economic-benchmarks.md](economic-benchmarks.md) only with its current instrumentation labels in mind.
6. For agent eval posture on Voice, run `python scripts/run_counterfactual_harness.py` (includes anchoring-stress probes CF-ANCH-*).

---

## Business path

Use this order when the question is how `work-build-ai` could become a real company rather than just a territory:

1. Open [offers.md](offers.md) and choose the first sellable diagnostic or architecture pass.
2. Confirm the target segment in [target-registry.md](target-registry.md).
3. Pull proof lines from [proof-ledger.md](proof-ledger.md).
4. Check [engagement-model.md](engagement-model.md) before inventing pricing or retainers.
5. Use [delivery-playbook.md](delivery-playbook.md) to keep implementation bounded.
6. Use [partner-channel.md](partner-channel.md) for borrowed-authority growth paths.
7. Log real objections in [objection-log.md](objection-log.md).
