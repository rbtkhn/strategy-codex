# Review packet template (work-strategy)

**Lane:** WORK (`work-strategy`). **Not** durable Record truth, **not** gate approval, **not** a merge substitute.

## Purpose

A **review packet** is a **derived** handoff artifact that bundles what was run (task intake, declared paths, optional carry receipt, validation JSON, task-shape JSON) into one structured document for **human** review. It mirrors the JSON emitted by [`scripts/work_strategy/build_review_packet.py`](../../../scripts/work_strategy/build_review_packet.py) and exists so serious runs leave a **deterministic** trace without pretending strategic correctness.

See [runtime-vs-record.md](../../runtime-vs-record.md) for canonical vs derived surfaces.

## When to generate

- After a **serious** carry-harness or validator pass when you want a **single** artifact to attach to a thread, ticket, or notebook knot.
- **Optional but encouraged** before gate-prep thinking: use it to see uncertainties and contradictions surfaced by validators **before** drafting paste snippets.

The packet **may still be created** when structural validation was not run; readiness will reflect that (typically `needs_review`).

## Sections A–J (human outline)

These align with the JSON fields in [`schemas/work_strategy_review_packet.schema.json`](../../../schemas/work_strategy_review_packet.schema.json).

| Section | Role | JSON |
|---------|------|------|
| **A — Task statement** | Title and excerpt of the task intake; what job was scoped. | `task` |
| **B — Task shape** | Primary shape, confidence, secondary candidates when a task-shape report exists. | `task_shape` |
| **C — Inputs** | Declared paths (task, sources, artifacts, optional JSON inputs) and existence notes. | `inputs` |
| **D — Handoff summary** | Factual bullets only: paths, counts, statuses — no invented strategy. | `handoff_summary` |
| **E — Uncertainties** | From validator rows (`unresolved_marker_scan`, `task_shape_expectations`) and optional marker scans. | `uncertainties` |
| **F — Contradictions / tension** | From `contradiction_marker_scan` and related signals. | `contradictions` |
| **G — Validator summary** | Overall validation status and notable non-pass checks. | `validation` |
| **H — Gate prep** | Whether a gate snippet path was present and non-empty; paste-only reminder. | `gate_prep` |
| **I — Review readiness** | Aggregated `pass` / `needs_review` / `fail` with a short reason. | `review_readiness` |
| **J — Why this is not canonical** | Explicit membrane: derived WORK artifact; companion gate governs Record merges. | `record_boundary` |

## Control-plane fields

The review packet is also a normalized **inspection** receipt. In addition to the A-J content blocks, it carries:

- `receipt_family` / `receipt_kind`
- `actor`
- `intent`
- `authority_class`
- `resources_read` / `resources_written`
- `status`
- `review_surface` / `rollback_surface`
- `record_authority`
- `gate_effect`

These fields do not replace the packet structure. They make the packet legible in the receipt crosswalk as an operator review surface with no Record authority and no direct gate mutation effect.

## Related docs

- [carry-harness.md](carry-harness.md) — optional `--build-review-packet` on the harness
- [validator-contract.md](validator-contract.md) — validation JSON shape
- [task-shape-routing.md](task-shape-routing.md) — task-shape JSON shape
- [runtime-vs-record.md](../../runtime-vs-record.md) — Record boundary

## CLI

```bash
python3 scripts/work_strategy/build_review_packet.py --help
```

Typical inputs reuse the same `--task`, `--source`, `--artifact`, and `--gate-snippet` paths as the carry harness, plus optional `--validation-report`, `--task-shape-report`, and `--carry-receipt`.
