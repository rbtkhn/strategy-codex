# Daily brief — work-politics & work-strategy

**Purpose:** One dated file: **work-politics snapshot** + **work-strategy focus** + **RSS ingest** with **two relevance scores** (W = campaign/KY-4, S = product/governance/tech), then operator synthesis.

**Filename (canonical):** `daily-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md` in this directory — stem `daily-brief-`, ISO date, `.md` only. Example: `daily-brief-2026-03-29.md`. Do not use other prefixes (e.g. `wap-`) or date formats for dated outputs.

Repository-wide date rules: [date-time-conventions.md](../../date-time-conventions.md).

**Canonical config:** [daily-brief-config.json](daily-brief-config.json)  
**Grok-style post-process layer (headings only — on top of generated §§):** [grok-daily-brief.md](grok-daily-brief.md)  
**Strategy focus bullets:** [daily-brief-focus.md](daily-brief-focus.md)  
**Weak-signal discipline:** [weak-signals.md](weak-signals.md)  
**Weak-signal block template:** [weak-signal-template.md](weak-signal-template.md)  
**Native-language triangulation (international stories):** [daily-brief-native-international-pass.md](daily-brief-native-international-pass.md)

## Generate

```bash
python scripts/generate_work_politics_daily_brief.py -u grace-mar \
  -o docs/skill-work/work-strategy/daily-brief-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md
```

- Default `--config` resolves to this folder’s `daily-brief-config.json`.
- Legacy: `docs/skill-work/work-politics/daily-brief-feeds.json` if strategy config is missing.
- `--no-fetch` — offline; work-politics + strategy sections still populate from docs/gate.
- `--brief-date YYYY-MM-DD` — override the brief’s **`Date:`** line when regenerating a
  historical filename; **`Assembled:`** still reflects the generator run time.

**Merge helper (regen + keep `§2c` tail):**

```bash
python3 scripts/merge_daily_brief_postprocess.py -u grace-mar --date 2026-04-14 --no-fetch
```

- Refuses to duplicate `§2c` unless you pass `--force` (strips any `§2c` block from
  the fresh generator output before splice).

## Sections in the output

| Section | Source |
|---------|--------|
| **1. work-politics snapshot** | `get_wap_snapshot()` |
| **1b. Work-strategy** | [daily-brief-focus.md](daily-brief-focus.md) + pointers to work-dev |
| **1c. Two horizons (fast vs slow)** | Operator prose in generator + [daily-brief-jiang-layer.md](daily-brief-jiang-layer.md) § **Active work-jiang hooks** — **slow** structural pointers (work-jiang); **fast** = §2 RSS + §1 (scored **W / S / G** in generator) |
| **1d. Putin — last 48 hours** | Operator fill per [daily-brief-putin-watch.md](daily-brief-putin-watch.md) + [daily-brief-native-international-pass.md](daily-brief-native-international-pass.md) when Russia is a load-bearing thread |
| **1e. JD Vance — last 48 hours** | Operator fill per [daily-brief-jd-vance-watch.md](daily-brief-jd-vance-watch.md) + [daily-brief-native-international-pass.md](daily-brief-native-international-pass.md) when Iran / third-country talks are load-bearing |
| **1f. Weak signal worth watching** | Operator block using [weak-signal-template.md](weak-signal-template.md); optional “none today” if threshold not met |
| **1g. PRC — last 48 hours** | Operator fill per [daily-brief-prc-watch.md](daily-brief-prc-watch.md) + [daily-brief-native-international-pass.md](daily-brief-native-international-pass.md) when the PRC / Beijing thread is load-bearing |
| **1h. IRI — last 48 hours** | Operator fill per [daily-brief-iran-watch.md](daily-brief-iran-watch.md) + [daily-brief-native-international-pass.md](daily-brief-native-international-pass.md) when the Iran / Islamabad thread is load-bearing; complements [islamabad-operator-index.md](islamabad-operator-index.md) |
| **2. Headlines** | RSS; each line `[W:x S:y]` ranked by **W+S** then recency |
| **3. Lead themes** | **W** campaign angle, **S** strategy angle, **slow** work-jiang stub (tie §1c to today’s headlines) |
| **4. Triangulation** | [work-politics analytical lenses](../work-politics/analytical-lenses/manifest.md) when the lead is political |
| **5–6** | Operator synthesis + work-politics next actions |
| **7** | **Context efficiency (CEL)** — optional footer when `platform/config/context_budgets/daily_brief.json` has `append_cel_footer: true`; links to [context-efficiency-layer.md](../context-efficiency-layer.md), [context-compaction-protocol.md](../context-compaction-protocol.md), `session_brief --compact` |

**Raw X / transcript strategy ingests:** Do **not** duplicate a full ingest list in this file — scratch lives in [../../codex/daily-strategy-inbox.md](../../../codex/daily-strategy-inbox.md) (paste-ready one-liner SSOT); **weave** into `days.md` per [STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md](../../../codex/STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md) § *Daily strategy inbox* (**`fold`** = legacy synonym).

## Weak signal rule

Each brief should include one compact weak-signal block (**§1f**) when a credible candidate exists.

A weak signal should:

- be early
- be incomplete
- matter strategically if true
- remain only low or medium confidence

Do not force an entry on low-information days. Use this line instead:

> No credible weak signal exceeded the threshold today.

When a weak signal includes a historical parallel, complete a short analogy audit using [analogy-audit-template.md](analogy-audit-template.md) and summarize the result inside **§1f**.

## Narrative layer retrofit (post-process on generated brief)

After generation, you may add a magazine-style narrative layer using
[grok-daily-brief.md](grok-daily-brief.md). This is an operator prose pass
on top of generated sections, not a replacement for source sections.

### Required narrative blocks

- **Executive summary**
- **Top developments** (3+ items recommended)
- **Signal vs noise**
- **Cross-domain synthesis**
- **Watchlist for tomorrow** (3-6 testable checks)
- **Bottom line**

### Per-development evidence contract

For each development block, include:

- `Evidence status: Primary-backed | Multi-source (wire-grade) | Single-source | Unverified`
- `Primary links:` 1-3 links from in-brief sources
- `Seam / tension:` required when channels disagree

### Quant / quote guardrail

Every numeric claim or attributed quote in the narrative layer must include
either a URL from the brief source chain or the literal marker:
`[UNVERIFIED — no primary found]`

### Named-mind layer policy (tri-mind deprecated)

**`tri-mind` / tri-frame is obsolete** — [TRI-MIND-DEPRECATED.md](TRI-MIND-DEPRECATED.md). Named-mind material is optional in the narrative layer. Add only when the operator **names one mind** or requests **`state-synthesis`** / **`periodic-statecraft-review`** runbook comparison.
Do not treat three-mind / tri-frame sections as a default for every brief.

### Canonical source boundary

The generated sections remain canonical for evidence anchoring:

- **§2 / §2a** for headline and geopolitical source inventory
- **§1d-§1h** for actor-channel watch passes when filled

Narrative prose may summarize and prioritize, but must not supersede the
verify contract in those sections.

### Completion checks (narrative layer)

A retrofit pass is complete when:

- At least 3 developments are populated
- Every development has evidence status and primary links
- At least one seam/tension is named when claims conflict
- Watchlist has testable checks for the next cycle

### Optional quality footer (0–2 scoring)

After the narrative layer (or at the end of the dated brief), you may append a
compact self-score table for drift tracking. Example criteria (0 missing, 1
partial, 2 strong):

- Epistemic discipline (URL + UNVERIFIED for hard claims)
- Plane separation (explicit seams)
- Handoff readiness (inbox + verify queue + conflict check)
- Primary-channel depth (`§1d–§1h` filled)
- Narrative closure (executive spine + bottom line)
- Noise control (signal vs noise)
- Tri-mind hygiene (no blended lens claims unless invoked)

### Inbox paste target (canonical)

When emitting **Handoff to Grace-Mar** inbox lines, follow the paste-ready unit
rules in
[../../codex/daily-strategy-inbox.md](../../../codex/daily-strategy-inbox.md)
— optional **`cold: … // hook: …`** split, **`verify:`** tails, optional
**`thread:<expert_id>`**, and optional **`membrane:*`** tokens.

**`verify:` token vocabulary (recommended defaults):**

- `verify:wire-RSS` — RSS-ingested wire / live-desk article (still not a state
  primary)
- `verify:wire-supported` / `verify:wire-unclear` / `verify:wire-contested` /
  `verify:wire-contradicted` — outcomes from **`wire verify`** triage (see
  `.cursor/skills/wire-verify/SKILL.md`)
- `verify:OSINT-unverified` — OSINT / social / analyst chain without stable
  primary capture
- `verify:tier-A` — operator-attested high-trust capture (per notebook tables)
- `verify:operator-transcript` — transcript / long paste pending quote-grade
  extraction
