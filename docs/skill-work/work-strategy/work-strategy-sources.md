# work-strategy — sources

Web reference outlets the operator tracks for **work-strategy framing** (geopolitics, defense, intelligence, energy, macro trends, long-arc analysis). **Not** Record truth. **Not** a substitute for [daily-brief-config.json](daily-brief-config.json) (RSS automation) or [external-tech-scan.md](external-tech-scan.md) (curated themes).

**Principle:** [Work modules — authorized sources lists](../work-modules-sources-principle.md).

**Territory boundary:** Keep this list separate from [work-politics sources](../work-politics/work-politics-sources.md) (campaign, elections, congressional) and [work-dev sources](../work-dev/work-dev-sources.md) (AI/tech, governance, cyber) unless the same feed genuinely serves both lanes.
