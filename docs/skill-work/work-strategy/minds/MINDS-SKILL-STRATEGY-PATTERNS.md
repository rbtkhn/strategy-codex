# Three Minds × `skill-strategy` — Repo-ready pattern note

> **`tri-mind` / tri-frame choreography is deprecated** (2026-06) — [TRI-MIND-DEPRECATED.md](../TRI-MIND-DEPRECATED.md). Patterns below are **legacy reference**; new work → **single named mind** or [`statecraft-multi-lens`](../../../.cursor/skills/statecraft-multi-lens/SKILL.md).

**Purpose:** Practical patterns for combining mind files with `skill-strategy` in Grace-Mar.  
**Status:** Brainstorm / advisory only; tri-frame defaults **retired**.  
**Primary surface:** `strategy-notebook` first; `STRATEGY.md` only on stabilization.

---

## Summary

- **Single-lens fast pass:** use one mind only when the day has one dominant uncertainty.
- **Two-lens tension pass:** use paired minds to expose a live contradiction without invoking full LEARN MODE.
- **Links-only lensing:** keep lens content out of `Judgment` and put it only in `Links` when the notebook entry should stay plain.
- **Verify-owned claims:** assign verification ownership by claim type before writing the judgment.
- **Lens-trigger phrases:** define lightweight operator phrases that map cleanly to one of the three minds.
- **Month-end lens audit:** use `meta.md` to review which lenses were overused, underused, or produced the best decisions.
- **Promotion gate by cross-day persistence:** promote only when a lens-shaped conclusion survives several daily blocks.
- **Plane-safe dual register:** when multiple lenses appear, force seams between negotiation, material, and narrative planes.
- **Jiang as separate cross-check:** use `### Jiang resonance` to test slow-corpus fit, not to crowd the daily judgment.
- **Machine-light tagging:** use minimal tags such as `[legit]`, `[power]`, `[liability]`, `[verify]`, not a heavy schema.
- **Tri-mind deliverables + coherence:** tri-frame can ship as lens-by-lens analysis, merged synthesis, prediction/debate divergence, or a short paste-under disagreement block; public appendices must not introduce new explanatory machinery the body did not earn.

---

## Grounding paths

### Mind files (load these — SSOT = expert `-mind.md`)

- [`strategy-expert-mercouris-mind.md`](../strategy-notebook/strategy-expert-mercouris-mind.md) — dated **operator corpus addenda** (e.g. **III.M** spoken-register scaffolds) live **in-file** under the mapped corpus; WORK emulation only — not substitute for tier-A verify on current facts. [`CIV-MIND-MERCOURIS.md`](../strategy-notebook/minds/CIV-MIND-MERCOURIS.md) redirects here.
- [`strategy-expert-mearsheimer-mind.md`](../strategy-notebook/strategy-expert-mearsheimer-mind.md) — [`CIV-MIND-MEARSHEIMER.md`](../strategy-notebook/minds/CIV-MIND-MEARSHEIMER.md) redirects here.
- [`strategy-expert-barnes-mind.md`](../strategy-notebook/strategy-expert-barnes-mind.md) — [`CIV-MIND-BARNES.md`](../strategy-notebook/minds/CIV-MIND-BARNES.md) redirects here.
- [`strategy-notebook/minds/README.md`](../strategy-notebook/minds/README.md)

### Optional upstream templates (civ-mem — diff / governance-only; not required for Grace-Mar)

If `research/repos/civilization_memory` is present:

- `docs/templates/CIV–MIND–MERCOURIS.md`
- `docs/templates/CIV–MIND–MEARSHEIMER.md`
- `docs/templates/CIV–MIND–BARNES.md`

**Grace-Mar canonical** mind bodies: strategy-expert **`-mind.md`** files under [`strategy-notebook/`](../strategy-notebook/) (SSOT); [`strategy-notebook/minds/CIV-MIND-*.md`](../strategy-notebook/minds/) are **redirects** to the same content.

**Strategy pass × civ-mem:** After frontier read (and tier-A verify for disputed current facts), `python3 scripts/suggest_civ_mem_from_relevance.py <ENTITY>` when `MEM–RELEVANCE–<ENTITY>.md` exists; cite MEM paths in **`### References`**. Tri-frame bridge: [CIV-MEM-TRI-FRAME-ROUTING.md](CIV-MEM-TRI-FRAME-ROUTING.md). Trump–Leo Barnes training sheet: [TRUMP-LEO-CIV-MEM-BARNES-DRILL.md](../strategy-notebook/TRUMP-LEO-CIV-MEM-BARNES-DRILL.md).

### Tri-frame entry index

- [`docs/skill-work/work-strategy/minds/README.md`](README.md) — expert bundle table (Mercouris / Mearsheimer / Barnes **`-mind.md`** + companion files).

### Strategy surfaces

- `.cursor/skills/skill-strategy/SKILL.md`
- `docs/skill-work/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/STRATEGY-NOTEBOOK-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/skill-work/work-strategy/LEARN_MODE_RULES.md`
- `.cursor/rules/strategy-minds-granular.mdc`

## Core principle

The strongest pattern is **not** “run all three minds on every pass.”  
The stronger pattern is:

1. **Plain notebook synthesis by default**
2. **One lens for speed**
3. **Two lenses for contradiction discovery**
4. **Tri-frame only on explicit demand**
5. **Verification whenever numbers or public-ship claims matter**
6. **Promotion only after cross-day stabilization**

---

## Tactics

### 1) Single-lens fast pass

**What:** Run one mind when the day’s problem is clearly one-dimensional.  
**When:** Crisis days, narrow drafting days, or when the operator wants speed.  
**Where in repo:** `strategy-notebook/chapters/YYYY-MM/days.md` under `### Reflection`, with one line in `### References` citing the relevant strategy-expert **`-mind.md`** (SSOT) or **`CIV-MIND-*.md`** redirect.  
**Cost:** Light.  
**Risk:** Overfitting the day to one lens and missing a hidden contradiction.

**Best use cases**

- **Mercouris only:** legitimacy, doctrine signaling, narrative grammar, symbolic continuity.
- **Mearsheimer only:** deterrence geometry, alliance movement, security dilemma.
- **Barnes only:** sanctions durability, material limits, shipping/oil/fiscal exposure.

---

### 2) Two-lens tension pass

**What:** Use two minds to stage a productive disagreement.  
**When:** The day’s judgment hinges on whether narrative, power, or material structure should dominate.  
**Where in repo:** `days.md`, either as a short split within `### Reflection` or as a dedicated `### Analogy / tension` subsection.  
**Cost:** Light to medium.  
**Risk:** Becoming a mini tri-frame without admitting it.

**Recommended pairings**

- **Mercouris + Mearsheimer:** “What story is being told?” versus “What power geometry compels behavior?”
- **Mearsheimer + Barnes:** “Who can escalate?” versus “Who can sustain it?”
- **Barnes + Mercouris:** “What is materially possible?” versus “What legitimacy story hides or reframes the material weakness?”

---

### 3) Links-only lensing

**What:** Keep the notebook prose plain, but attach lens-specific files in `### References` rather than writing overt lens labels in the judgment.  
**When:** Synthesis days where overt labels would clutter the prose.  
**Where in repo:** `### References`, with optional shorthand like `Mercouris lens only` or `Barnes check deferred`.  
**Cost:** Light.  
**Risk:** The lens effect becomes too implicit and easy to forget later.

**Why it matters:** This best preserves the repo’s granular-control rule: plain `Chronicle / Reflection / References` should remain valid without mandatory M/M/B headings.

---

### 4) Verify-owned claims

**What:** Assign who “owns” the need for verification before finalizing judgment.  
**When:** Any day involving numbers, shipping, casualties, sanctions, oil, market pricing, force counts, or public-facing claims.  
**Where in repo:** Add `### Web verification (YYYY-MM-DD)` in the daily block, then list supporting URLs under `### References`.  
**Cost:** Medium.  
**Risk:** Verification grows into a second workflow and bloats the notebook.

**Ownership map**

- **Barnes / verify:** oil, trade flow, ship counts, costs, supply stress, sanctions effects.
- **Mercouris / verify:** official statements, doctrine claims, legitimacy narratives, procedural claims.
- **Mearsheimer / verify:** alliance moves, deployments, strategic postures, publicly claimed red lines.

---

### 5) Lens-trigger phrases

**What:** Create short operator phrases that force a bounded lens choice.  
**When:** Live sessions where speed matters.  
**Where in repo:** Optional small note in `docs/skill-work/work-strategy/minds/README.md` or a Cursor rule comment.  
**Cost:** Light.  
**Risk:** Too many trigger phrases become a second command language.

**Examples**

- `Barnes check this`
- `Mercouris read only`
- `Mearsheimer sharpen this`
- `Two-lens: Mercouris then Barnes`
- `Tri-frame, strict`
- `Plain strategy, no labels`

---

### 6) Month-end lens audit

**What:** Review in `meta.md` which lenses were actually useful that month.  
**When:** Month close or after a major arc ends.  
**Where in repo:** `strategy-notebook/chapters/YYYY-MM/meta.md`  
**Cost:** Medium.  
**Risk:** Retroactive rationalization.

**Questions**

- Which lens produced the most durable judgments?
- Which lens produced the most false alarms?
- Which recurring arc needed a second lens earlier?
- Which promoted entries in `STRATEGY.md` survived later scrutiny?

---

### 7) Promotion gate by cross-day persistence

**What:** Do not promote a lens-shaped conclusion until it appears across several daily blocks or survives a verification pass.  
**When:** Before touching `STRATEGY.md`  
**Where in repo:** notebook first, then optional promotion to `STRATEGY.md`  
**Cost:** Medium.  
**Risk:** Slow promotion can make the ledger too conservative.

**Simple rule**

Promote only when one of these is true:

- Same lens conclusion appears on **3 separate days**
- **2 different lenses** converge on the same conclusion
- The conclusion has a **verify pass** plus **1 later confirming day**

---

### 8) Plane-safe dual register

**What:** If more than one lens is used, force explicit seams between negotiation scope, material facts, and narrative framing.  
**When:** Iran/U.S., Gulf, Rome, Vatican, Israel/Iran, Russia/Ukraine/Putin, U.S.–China / PRC state lines, or any multi-plane topic.  
**Where in repo:** `### Reflection` with labeled sub-lines or a short three-bullet split before synthesis.  
**Cost:** Medium.  
**Risk:** Slightly more formal prose.

**Example pattern**

- **Negotiation plane:** what deal space exists
- **Material plane:** what can actually be sustained
- **Narrative plane:** what legitimacy story is being projected
- **Vatican / Holy See plane (when Rome is in play):** papal or curial speech as **IHL / moral–legal vocabulary** and **legitimacy** — **not** a substitute for **kinetic** or **Beltway** facts; label explicitly when **Leo XIV** lines sit in the same day as **Islamabad** or **Lebanon mechanics** ingests ([NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md](../strategy-notebook/NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md), [ROME-PASS.md](../work-strategy-rome/ROME-PASS.md)).
- **VP / U.S. executive channel (when JD Vance is in play):** **White House** / **wire** **attributed** lines on **role** (delegation lead, coalition framing) — **not** a substitute for **Tehran** or **field** facts; label explicitly when **§1e** / **Vance** copy sits the same day as **Pentagon**, **State**, or **allied** readouts that **diverge** on **scope** ([daily-brief-jd-vance-watch.md](../daily-brief-jd-vance-watch.md), [NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md](../strategy-notebook/NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md)).
- **Kremlin / Russia executive channel (when Putin is in play):** **Kremlin.ru** / **wire** **attributed** **quotes** and **signaling** — **not** a substitute for **Ukrainian**, **Iranian**, or **battlefield** **facts**; label explicitly when **§1d** / **Putin** copy sits the same day as **NATO**, **White House**, or **Tehran** lines that **diverge** on **terms** or **scope** ([daily-brief-putin-watch.md](../daily-brief-putin-watch.md), [NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md](../strategy-notebook/NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md)).
- **PRC / MFA channel (when Beijing is in play):** **MFA** / **state** **English** pages and **attributed** **lines** — **not** a substitute for **U.S.**, **Taiwan**, or **partner** **facts** on the same story; label explicitly when **§1g** / **PRC** copy sits the same day as **White House**, **allied**, or **Western** “China” **analysis** that **diverge** on **terms** or **scope** ([daily-brief-prc-watch.md](../daily-brief-prc-watch.md), [NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md](../strategy-notebook/NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md)).
- **IRI / Tehran state channel (when Iran is in play):** **MFA** / **IRNA** / **presidency** **attributed** **lines** — **not** a substitute for **Islamabad** **gap-matrix** **structure** alone; label explicitly when **§1h** / **IRI** copy sits the same day as **U.S.** **executive**, **allied**, or **Western** “Iran” **digest** that **diverge** on **pause**, **Hormuz**, or **nuclear** **scope** ([daily-brief-iran-watch.md](../daily-brief-iran-watch.md), [islamabad-operator-index.md](../islamabad-operator-index.md), [NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md](../strategy-notebook/NOTEBOOK-PREFERENCES.md)).

---

### 9) Jiang as separate cross-check

**What:** Treat `### Jiang resonance` as a slow-corpus check, not as another analyst lens.  
**When:** When the notebook judgment seems to echo a prior historical thesis or lecture.  
**Where in repo:** `### Jiang resonance` plus the relevant lecture or an honest `deferred` note.  
**Cost:** Light.  
**Risk:** False historical elevation of a news-day thesis.

**Guardrail:** Headlines are not a substitute for an ingested thesis.

---

### 10) Machine-light tagging

**What:** Use minimal tags such as `[legit]`, `[power]`, `[liability]`, `[verify]`, `[defer]`.  
**When:** Only if it improves searchability.  
**Where in repo:** Inline in `days.md`  
**Cost:** Light.  
**Risk:** Tag sprawl.

**Rule of thumb:** human-readable first, machine-friendly second.

---

### 11) Tri-mind deliverables, coherence, and falsifiers

**What:** Treat tri-frame as **multiple export shapes**, not a single “three parallel summaries” template. Common shapes: **lens-by-lens** (Barnes → Mearsheimer → Mercouris), **one merged synthesis paragraph**, **prediction divergence / debate** (where lenses disagree and what would falsify each), and a **short paste-under disagreement block** for public copy.  
**When:** The operator asks for tri-mind, tri-frame, or an explicit multi-lens stress test; or when exporting strategy analysis to **Locals / X** as an appendix.  
**Where in repo:** `days.md` under `### Reflection` / `### Analogy / tension`, or a companion note linked from `### References`; public copy stays outside the notebook if it is not Record-bound.  
**Cost:** Medium if you run all shapes; light if you pick one shape deliberately.  
**Risk:** Meta-framing (“this stacks three readings”) can read weaker than **findings-first** prose on short-form platforms.

**Coherence rule (public copy):** Do not append analytical scaffolding in a conclusion that **introduces new mechanism lists** the body did not establish. Prefer a **hinge sentence** that restates the real bottleneck in plain language.

**Falsifier habit:** Close debate-style passes with **what evidence would move you toward Barnes vs Mearsheimer vs Mercouris** (validator breaks / exposure vs material shifts vs narrative decoherence).

**US settlement / coalition shortcut (Barnes-heavy):** When the thread is “sell the deal at home,” map **Fox / Graham wing** (and adjacent coalition validators) as a **coalition jury** and “radioactive formulations” as **ownership and exposure**, not as optional moral garnish.

**Domestic U.S. interpretation split (third axis):** When the same **lever** (e.g. **Hormuz** / **blockade**) appears in **bilateral** U.S.–Iran reporting **and** in **U.S. domestic** commentary, hold **three** story types in view—not two: **Tehran-facing** (signability / credibility), **coalition-facing** (D.C. sell / war-powers), and **domestic-feed** splits (e.g. **decisive leverage** op-ed vs **satirical escalation-spiral** thread). Those are **not** neutral translations of one another. Label **analyst** vs **wire** vs **primary**; **operational** claims remain **verify-first** (DoD / WH / Navy readouts).

---

## Three recipes

### Recipe A — Single-lens day

**Ensemble gloss:** **Solo** — one part carries the day’s line; other parts **tacet** or implicit via plain Judgment.

**Operator phrase:**  
`Strategy. Barnes only. Verify oil and shipping if used.`

**Agent moves**

1. Read notebook frontier and today’s relevant inputs.
2. Append today’s block in `days.md`.
3. In `### Chronicle`, summarize only what crossed the strategy threshold.
4. In `### Reflection`, write one Barnes-shaped paragraph: material constraint, liabilities, who can sustain what.
5. If numbers are load-bearing, add `### Web verification (YYYY-MM-DD)`.
6. In `### References`, include the relevant brief/transcript plus [`strategy-expert-barnes-mind.md`](../strategy-notebook/strategy-expert-barnes-mind.md) (or the [`CIV-MIND-BARNES.md`](../strategy-notebook/minds/CIV-MIND-BARNES.md) redirect). **Optional civ-mem:** If `research/repos/civilization_memory` is checked out and structural precedent helps, add **1–2** upstream `MEM–…` file receipts (see [TRUMP-LEO-CIV-MEM-BARNES-DRILL.md](../strategy-notebook/TRUMP-LEO-CIV-MEM-BARNES-DRILL.md) for Trump–Leo / Rome + U.S. pairing); never substitute MEM for tier-A wires on breaking claims.
7. In `### Foresight`, carry one falsifiable follow-up.

**Use when**

- Shipping risk
- Energy chokepoints
- Fiscal exhaustion
- Resource asymmetry
- Sanctions durability

---

### Recipe B — Two-lens day

**Ensemble gloss:** **Duet** — two parts in counterpoint; the synthesis sentence names **converge** or **tension** (unresolved dissonance is valid).

**Operator phrase:**  
`Strategy pass. Mercouris then Mearsheimer. Keep it notebook-only, no promotion.`

**Agent moves**

1. Read notebook frontier.
2. In `### Chronicle`, note the event or thesis that matters.
3. In `### Reflection`, use two short sub-sections:
   - **Mercouris:** narrative legitimacy, doctrine posture, symbolic continuity
   - **Mearsheimer:** alliance geometry, deterrence, compulsion
4. Add one synthesis sentence: either `converge` or `tension`.
5. Put source files in `### References`.
6. Put unresolved contradiction in `### Foresight`.

**Use when**

- Official story and strategic structure point in different directions
- A speech, summit, or doctrine statement matters
- You need sharper distinction between symbolism and coercive geometry

---

### Recipe C — Explicit tri-frame / LEARN day

**Ensemble gloss:** **Tutti** — full score: all three parts explicit in one pass; preserve contradictions between frames (sectional balance in rehearsal, not a single blended voice).

**Operator phrase:**  
`LEARN MODE — TRI-FRAME — Hormuz coercion and bargaining.`

**Agent moves**

1. Declare mode exactly as required by `LEARN_MODE_RULES.md`.
2. Load [`STRATEGY.md`](../STRATEGY.md): **§I CORE**, relevant **lane-specific core** (§II), **§III SCHOLAR** as needed, and relevant **§IV** (operator strategy log in this file only — not CMC `MEM–*` shards under `research/repos/civilization_memory/`). Load the three strategy-expert **`-mind.md`** files (SSOT; see [minds/README.md](README.md) table).
3. Run failure-first scan.
4. Apply in the mandated order:
   - Mercouris
   - Mearsheimer
   - Barnes
5. Preserve contradictions between frames.
6. Convert insights into the required heuristic format (`LEARN_MODE_RULES.md` § Extraction rules).
7. End with the Assimilation Summary.
8. Keep the notebook entry shorter than the full analysis by compressing synthesis and linking the heavier artifact.

**Use when**

- The operator explicitly asks for tri-frame
- A major recurring arc needs deeper extraction
- A notebook thesis may be nearing promotion
- A complex judgment needs stronger preservation of contradictions

---

## Stretch ideas

### Stretch 1 — Lens audit helper script

A small script could scan `days.md` for `[legit]`, `[power]`, `[liability]`, `[verify]` tags and auto-summarize monthly lens usage into `meta.md`.

**Why it may be worth it**

- Makes lens usage visible
- Creates empirical review of mind utility
- Keeps implementation lightweight

**Why it may not**

- Tagging discipline may decay
- Too much automation may over-formalize work notes

---

### Stretch 2 — Cursor rule refinement for “plain strategy”

Add a tiny companion rule that recognizes:

- `plain strategy`
- `no labels`
- `notebook only`
- `no tri-frame`

and suppresses explicit mind headings even if a mind file is consulted internally.

**Benefit:** strengthens granular control.  
**Risk:** hidden internal lens use becomes less visible unless logged in `Links`.

---

### Stretch 3 — Promotion lint

A CI or pre-commit check could warn if `STRATEGY.md` was edited on a day with:

- no corresponding notebook block
- no verify subsection where numbers are load-bearing
- no carried-forward open question or cross-day persistence marker

**Benefit:** hardens notebook-first discipline.  
**Risk:** adds friction to legitimate fast promotions.

---

### Stretch 4 — Pairing cheat sheet

Create a one-page advisory note under `docs/skill-work/work-strategy/minds/`:

- topic classes
- recommended single-lens default
- recommended two-lens pairing
- when tri-frame is actually justified
- common anti-patterns by topic class

**Benefit:** makes operator usage faster.  
**Risk:** could drift toward pseudo-policy if not labeled advisory.

---

## Explicit non-goals

- Do **not** make tri-frame the default on every strategy pass.
- Do **not** turn `days.md` into three full summaries in sequence.
- Do **not** treat mind files as autonomous personas or belief engines.
- Do **not** merge negotiation, material, and narrative planes into a single sentence without seams.
- Do **not** imply Predictive History alignment from headlines alone.
- Do **not** promote notebook content into Record or Voice through work-strategy alone.
- Do **not** let the trimmed notebook copies drift from canonical mind templates — update both when a new version ships.
- Do **not** build a heavy schema before proving that light tagging is insufficient.

---

## Post-entry lens offer (standard menu behavior)

After any **substantive** notebook entry — daily brief ingest, standalone strategy pass, transcript digest — the agent includes a three-option lens block in the WORK menu:

- **Barnes:** one line adapted to the day's material (liability, cost, who pays)
- **Mearsheimer:** one line (power distribution, structural incentive, security dilemma)
- **Mercouris:** one line (legitimacy, institutional continuity, civilizational pattern)

Always **B → M → M** order. Always optional. Phrasing adapts to the day's signals. The operator picks one, combines two, or skips. If a lens is picked, the agent appends the lens block to the same day's entry per Recipe A (single) or Recipe B (two-lens with tension section). Trivial entries do not trigger the offer. See [skill-strategy SKILL.md](../../../../.cursor/skills/skill-strategy/SKILL.md) § Post-entry lens offer.

---

## Recommended default operating pattern

### Default

Plain notebook synthesis + **post-entry lens offer** (three options in WORK menu; operator picks or skips).

### Escalate to one lens when

- one uncertainty dominates
- speed matters
- the operator names a lens

### Escalate to two lenses when

- the key value is contradiction discovery
- symbolism and structure seem misaligned
- material capability and narrative posture diverge

### Escalate to tri-frame when

- the operator explicitly asks
- LEARN MODE is active
- a major arc needs durable extraction
- promotion may be near

### Promote only when

- a conclusion persists across days
- verification is present when needed
- the judgment survives a second pass or a second lens

---

## Bottom line

The best implementation path is a **graduated lens system**, not a compulsory three-mind stack.

Use:

- **plain strategy** as the base,
- **single-lens** for speed,
- **two-lens** for tension,
- **tri-frame** for explicit deep-analysis,
- and **verification discipline** whenever numbers or public-ship claims matter.

That keeps the notebook usable, preserves repo boundaries, and makes the three minds a source of analytical leverage rather than recurring overhead.
