# PRC — last 48 hours (People’s Republic of China) (coffee menu C — Strategy (daily brief) / daily brief)

**Purpose:** Standing **operator WORK** slice for the daily brief: **Beijing’s public lines and visible PRC state activity** (party–state leadership, **MFA**, major ministries when relevant) in a **rolling 48-hour** window (not Record truth, not Voice knowledge).

**When:** When the operator chooses **coffee menu C — Strategy (daily brief)** in the [coffee skill](../../../.cursor/skills/coffee/SKILL.md) (legacy **hey** still works): run the **web scan**, then write the **compact block** (bullets + URLs) into **§1g** (`## 1g. PRC — last 48 hours (People’s Republic of China)`) **in the daily brief file** after `generate_work_politics_daily_brief.py` (or when refreshing an existing today’s file). Step 1 **coffee** does **not** run this scan — it is part of **C** only.

---

## What to cover

- **Foreign Ministry (MFA)** regular briefings, **readouts**, and **summits / calls** with **date/time (UTC if possible)**.
- **State Council / NDRC / commerce** lines when they move **trade**, **sanctions**, or **regional** framing in the window.
- **Cross-strait**, **South China Sea**, or **Russia–Iran–U.S.** stories only when **PRC** is a **named** party in the day’s strategy thread — attribute to **official** text or **wire quoting MFA**.
- If **nothing material** in 48h: one line — *“No major new PRC/MFA statements located in window; see MFA regular briefing index for minor items.”*

## Canonical surfaces (bookmark)

| Surface | URL | Notes |
|--------|-----|-------|
| MFA — press conferences / spokes | [fmprc.gov.cn](https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/) | Primary for diplomatic wording (EN / ä¸­æ–‡) |
| Xinhua (English) | [english.news.cn](http://www.news.cn/english/) | State news; label as such |
| PRC embassy / mission (when U.S.–China day) | mission-specific | Readouts, statements |
| Reuters — China | [reuters.com/world/china](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/) | Cross-check time and phrasing |
| Caixin Global / SCMP | independent HK/region English | Use with **independence** note vs state wire |

**Native-language triangulation:** When the **PRC** thread is load-bearing, add **at least one Mandarin-primary line** (MFA Chinese, Xinhua ä¸­æ–‡, People’s Daily äººæ°‘ç½‘ as needed) per [daily-brief-native-international-pass.md](daily-brief-native-international-pass.md) — not optional for full §1g passes on active **U.S.–China**, **cross-strait**, or **Indo-Pacific** crisis days.

## Guardrails

- **Cite URLs** for each bullet used in client-facing or posted material.
- **Do not** merge into SELF, EVIDENCE, or `bot/prompt.py` without the gated pipeline.
- **RSS §2** of the daily brief may surface China-adjacent headlines; it **does not** replace this pass (timing, full MFA quotes, bilingual check).
- **Do not** treat **Western** “China hawk” **analysis** as **Beijing’s** position without **MFA / state** **alignment**.
