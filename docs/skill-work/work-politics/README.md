# work-politics

**Rename (2026):** Formerly `work-american-politics`, then `work-political-consulting`. **RECURSION-GATE** territory string is now **`work-politics`**. **CLI preferred:** `--territory work-politics` (shorthand **`pol`** or **`wp`**; legacy **`wap`** still accepted). Receipt JSON uses **`"territory": "work-politics"`** for new merges. Legacy YAML with `territory: work-american-politics` or `territory: work-political-consulting` still counts as **work-politics territory** until edited ([`recursion_gate_territory.py`](../../../scripts/recursion_gate_territory.py)).

**Prose vs technical tokens:** In writing, prefer **work-politics** (or **work-politics territory**). Use **`operator:pol:â€¦`** for new `channel_key` prefixes; **`operator:wap:â€¦`** remains valid for older rows. Avoid the informal acronym **WAP** in documentation and UI copy.

**GitHub / gate CI:** [LANE-CI.md](LANE-CI.md) â€” PR labels, when **`lane/cross`** applies, canonical `### CANDIDATE-*` paste shape, and the paste-snippet CLI.

**Objective:** **Political consulting** umbrella â€” US federal, **state**, **local**; **international** only after [compliance-checklist.md](compliance-checklist.md) sign-off. AI-assisted briefs, opposition tracking, message discipline, content ops; **human approves** all public ship. **Primary client (Phase 1):** Thomas Massie (R-KY-4) shadow campaign. Companion-led; no autonomous political action.

---

## Purpose

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Shadow campaign manager** | Provide behind-the-scenes support: daily/weekly briefs, opposition research, message drafts, event/schedule context, and talking points. Human approves all public-facing content and strategy. |
| **Record context** | Document principal profile, race context, key issues, and opposition so the Record can inform briefs and Voice responses when the companion queries. |
| **WORK integration** | Campaign support (research, drafting, tracking) maps to WORK; ACT- evidence can capture milestones (e.g. â€œwe published opposition memo,â€ â€œwe briefed on debateâ€) via gated pipeline. |

**Principal:** U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY-4). See [principal-profile.md](principal-profile.md).

**Invariant:** The companion (operator) is the decision-maker. The agent drafts, researches, and tracks; it does not make campaign strategy, endorse, or merge political claims into the Record without staging and companion approval.

**work-dev cross-link:** Harness replay demos, video takeaway notes (OpenClaw, Perplexity, DeepSeek, solo-founder), competitor scans, capability one-pager, and actionable feature backlogs for the assistant-brain / integration line live under **[work-dev](../work-dev/README.md)**. This folder keeps campaign doctrine, polyphonic **protocol** specs, and KY/Massie surfaces; [workspace.md](workspace.md) lists both with paths.

---

## Sync with RECURSION-GATE

> **Record frozen:** Gate sync below applies only on explicit **`fork revive`**. Default work-politics capture uses lane docs + [replacement-capture-habits.md](../../replacement-capture-habits.md) — not ambient RECURSION-GATE staging.

Work-politics work lives in **two places**: this folder (**docs**, working truth) and **`recursion-gate.md`** (gated merges into SELF / EVIDENCE / prompt — **fork revive only**). Optimal sync = **know which lane** and **touch the gate on a rhythm** when the fork lane is open.

**Audit replay (example):** [harness-replay-work-politics-demo.md](../work-dev/harness-replay-work-politics-demo.md) â€” run `replay_harness_event.py` on a work-politics `CANDIDATE-*` and read pipeline / harness / receipts alongside gate YAML.

### Doc-only (no candidate)

Keep in git only when:

- Drafts, scratch opposition notes, internal SMM runbooks â€” iterate freely.
- Nothing must **constrain Voice** this week and no **paid / audit** line needed in EVIDENCE yet.

### Stage to RECURSION-GATE when

1. **Voice / PRP should reflect it** â€” companion wants the fork to â€œknowâ€ something for queries (then merge touches prompt or IX â€” still companion-approved).
2. **Paid or milestone audit** â€” deliverable closed, revenue event, â€œwe shipped Xâ€ â†’ **ACT-** trail; use [pol-candidate-template.md](pol-candidate-template.md).
3. **Explicit companion approval** of a fact for the Record â€” same gated rule as Abby pipeline; no merge on agent say-so alone.

### Territory (required for work-politics rows)

Every work-politics candidate must include **`territory: work-politics`** so reports and **`--territory work-politics`** batch merge stay clean.

### Gate convention â€” `channel_key` (multi-client)

Encode **jurisdiction + client slug** so milestones stay sortable without new territory ids:

| Pattern | Example | Use |
|---------|---------|-----|
| `operator:pol:<jurisdiction>-<slug>` | `operator:pol:us-ky4-massie` | Default (preferred) |
| `operator:pol:us-state-<ST>-<slug>` | `operator:pol:us-state-tx-senate-smith` | State |
| `operator:pol:us-local-<ST>-<city>-<slug>` | `operator:pol:us-local-oh-toledo-mayor` | Local |
| `operator:pol:intl-<CC>-<slug>` | `operator:pol:intl-gb-council` | International (only if compliance cleared) |

**Invariant:** `territory` stays **`work-politics`** for all rows above. See [clients/_template.md](clients/_template.md), [pol-candidate-template.md](pol-candidate-template.md).

### IX vs ACT (policy)

- **Default for work-politics merges:** prefer **ACT- + minimal IX** unless the companion wants campaign substance in Abbyâ€™s IX-A/B/C. Opposition and strategy need not become the childâ€™s self-knowledge.
- **INTENT:** When campaign posture shifts materially, consider a separate candidate or INTENT edit **through the gate** so long agents align â€” optional but high leverage.

### Civ-mem â†’ drafts (human-always-approves)

CMC may **inform** speeches and policy memos via retrieval + scaffold; **nothing ships** without explicit human approval per stage. See [civ-mem-draft-protocol.md](civ-mem-draft-protocol.md) and worked [civ-mem-test-run-2026-03-14.md](civ-mem-test-run-2026-03-14.md).

### Rhythm

At least **weekly** (e.g. before weekly brief): either **one work-politics candidate** capturing what merged Voice/audit-wise, or an explicit **â€œdoc-only this weekâ€** â€” avoids drift between `docs/skill-work/work-politics/` and the gate.

### Template

**[pol-candidate-template.md](pol-candidate-template.md)** â€” paste-ready YAML; name artifacts in `summary` (`iran-foreign-policy-brief.md`, `revenue-log` row).

### Operational SQLite engine (optional)

WORK-lane state **beside** the gate (not a replacement): clients, engagements, an operator review queue (`WPR-*` ids), and funnel events. Stored at **`work-politics/work-politics.db`** (local; gitignored). Implementation: [`scripts/work_politics_engine.py`](../../../scripts/work_politics_engine.py). **RECURSION-GATE** remains canonical for `CANDIDATE-*` and merges via `process_approved_candidates.py`; optional `approved_candidate_id` on a review row can reference a gate id after companion merge.

- **HTTP:** [`platform/apps/gate-review-app.py`](../../../platform/apps/gate-review-app.py) exposes JSON under `/api/work-politics/*` when the app runs with `OPERATOR_SECRET` (same auth as gate review).
- **Metrics:** [platform/apps/metrics-dashboard.py](../../../platform/apps/metrics-dashboard.py) shows 30d funnel revenue and pending WPR items when Streamlit is available.
- **Seed:** `python scripts/bootstrap_work_politics.py` â€” dev convenience for KY-4 client + sample engagement (operator must set compliance cleared; not legal advice).

---

## Lifecycle

**Phase 1 â€” Primary (~3 months):** Now through **May 19, 2026** (KY-4 primary). Focus: shadow campaign support for Massie â€” briefs, opposition, message discipline, X, calendar. See [calendar-2026.md](calendar-2026.md).

**Phase 2 â€” Bifurcation by result:** After the primary, the next political objective depends on the outcome:

| Result | Possible next objective (companion-led) |
|--------|------------------------------------------|
| **Massie wins** | Continue support into general election; or wind down shadow role; or repurpose to other Massie-related work. |
| **Massie loses** | Pivot to supporting **other candidates** â€” e.g. campaigns aligned with similar positions (war powers, civil liberties, transparency), or other races where the same shadow-capacity is useful. |

The skill stays **work-politics**; the principal and scope can shift (e.g. new principal profile, new calendar, same support menu). Companion decides the next objective; the agent adapts to the new context once documented.

---

## Risk mitigation (template â€” Tier 1+)

Per [work-template/README.md](../work-template/README.md) Â§ *Risk-mitigation checklist*. Filled for **shadow campaign + brief + gate** obligations (human approves all public ship; SQLite / outreach are optional lanes).

### 1. Quantitative success criteria

| Metric | Target | How to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Public ship discipline | **Zero** agent-autonomous posts or paid outreach on behalf of the principal | [account-x.md](account-x.md) / SMM workflow â€” human (or designated SMM) posts; agent output stays draft |
| Brief readiness | Sources and Â§0 recency within [brief-source-registry.md](brief-source-registry.md) â€œwatch/needs_refreshâ€ budget before relying on a brief for decisions | [workspace.md](workspace.md) dashboard / registry rows; warmup **brief readiness** line when applicable |
| Gate lane hygiene | At least **weekly** â€” one work-politics `CANDIDATE-*` path **or** explicit **doc-only this week** | [Â§ Rhythm](#sync-with-recursion-gate) â€” avoids silent drift between `docs/â€¦/work-politics/` and `recursion-gate.md` |

### 2. Sustainment table

| Task | Cadence | What to check |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Weekly / daily brief cadence | Weekly (before key dates); daily when operator runs strategy+politics horizon | [workspace.md](workspace.md) path; generator commands still match [Operator path](#operator-path) |
| Principal and opposition surfaces | On race news or companion request | [principal-profile.md](principal-profile.md), [opposition-brief.md](opposition-brief.md) still match public filings and stated positions |
| Compliance | Before **international** or sensitive paid scope | [compliance-checklist.md](compliance-checklist.md) |
| SQLite / WPR queue (if used) | Weekly light pass when engine is active | `WPR-*` not stale without owner; optional [Â§ Operational SQLite engine](#operational-sqlite-engine-optional) |

### 3. Deprecation / retirement path

1. **Companion ends active shadow support** for the current principal â€” explicit decision ([Â§ Phase 2](#lifecycle) already frames bifurcation).
2. Close or hand off open **WPR** / content-queue items with status notes; companion-approved **RECURSION-GATE** rows still merge on normal pipeline (`process_approved_candidates.py`), not abandoned mid-merge.
3. Archive principal-specific experiments and dated campaign notes under **git history + dated pointers** in this folder (e.g. README â€œlast phaseâ€ line), not by deleting audit or revenue logs.
4. Remove or downgrade automation (brief scripts, optional SQLite) only after no operator relies on the path; **never** treat `recursion-gate.md` as disposable history.

### 4. Scope creep guardrail

> Any workflow that **posts publicly**, **commits the principalâ€™s name to outreach**, or **merges campaign substance into Voice / IX / Record** without [Â§ Sync with RECURSION-GATE](#sync-with-recursion-gate) and companion approval is **out of charter**. Incremental â€œjust this onceâ€ public or paid moves require an explicit plan â€” not a silent doc edit. This lane is **research + draft + staged evidence**; **sovereignty stays with the companion.**

---

## Revenue / monetization

This workflow can support revenue when someone pays for campaign content â€” e.g. Thomas Massie briefs, research, opposition memos, message drafts, or X copy. The system produces the content; the companion controls who pays, whatâ€™s delivered, pricing, and terms. No autonomous deals or commitments; any paid engagement is companion-led. Same support menu and principles apply; payment is a use case, not a change of role.

**Real-world manifestation:** Paid work-politics engagements use **Bitcoin** for payments when possible; the companion receives payment and issues **receipts**. Where the platform is fiat (e.g. Fiverr), thatâ€™s acceptable: the workflow is influencing (in a friendly way) a human to make the paymentâ€”the value prop and the deliverable persuade; the human chooses to pay. The rail is secondary; the win is the human deciding to pay after engaging with what we offer.

**First revenue achieved:** **2026-03-11** â€” **$50,000 seed investment** from a human who committed capital after engaging with the value proposition, artifacts (briefs, principal profile, Iran brief, economic speculation), and narrative (bounded product, Bitcoin, receipts). The agent presented the case; the human chose to give.

## Principles

1. **Companion sovereignty** â€” Campaign strategy and public positioning are the companionâ€™s. The agent supports with research and drafts; it does not direct.
2. **Knowledge boundary** â€” Briefs and Voice responses use documented Record content and cited sources. No unsourced or inferred political claims.
3. **Gated pipeline** â€” New campaign-relevant facts or claims (opposition research, issue positions) enter the Record only via staging and companion approval.
4. **RECURSION-GATE territory** â€” work-politics candidates (see [Â§ Sync](#sync-with-recursion-gate), [pol-candidate-template.md](pol-candidate-template.md)): add **`territory: work-politics`** and **`channel_key: operator:pol:â€¦`** (or legacy `operator:wap:â€¦`) so operator tools can filter work-politics vs companion pending (`operator_blocker_report`, `session_brief`, `harness_warmup` â€” `--territory work-politics` | `companion` | `all`; aliases **`pol`**, `wp`, legacy `wap`). **Batch merge work-politics only:** approve work-politics rows, then
   `python scripts/process_approved_candidates.py -u grace-mar --territory work-politics --generate-receipt /tmp/work-politics-receipt.json --approved-by <name>`
   `python scripts/process_approved_candidates.py -u grace-mar --territory work-politics --apply --approved-by <name> --receipt /tmp/work-politics-receipt.json`
   Companion-approved rows stay in the gate until you run `--territory companion` or `all`.
5. **Shadow only** â€” No autonomous posting. The X account "America First Kentucky (Unofficial)" is operated by Xavier (SMM); the agent drafts tweets and threads for Xavier to review and post.
6. **Evidence-grounded** â€” Milestones (â€œwe did Xâ€) stage as ACT- evidence; merge only after approval.
7. **Triangulated lenses (current events)** â€” For full weekly briefs and heavy analytical drafts, run the three **WORK-only** lenses on the same neutral fact summary; surface tensions; finalize synthesis under human sign-off. See [analytical-lenses/manifest.md](analytical-lenses/manifest.md) and [weekly-brief-template.md](weekly-brief-template.md) Â§7.
8. **Simple in, more work out** â€” Think like a child: short prompts, one step at a time. The agent fills in the how and does the drafting. Better.
9. **High-stakes guardrail stress-test (america-first-ky)** â€” For war powers, insider/ethics, cartel-economy, and border+civil-liberty briefs, run the factorial stress-test protocol in [america-first-ky/guardrail-stress-test.md](america-first-ky/guardrail-stress-test.md) before final ship. **Operator/process only** â€” not `governance_checker.py`; no routine full traces to `self-evidence.md`.

## Operator path

**North star (lane):** [docs/lanes/work-politics.md](../../lanes/work-politics.md) Â· **Weekly rhythm:** [docs/lanes/WEEKLY-RHYTHM.md](../../lanes/WEEKLY-RHYTHM.md)

Use this order when actively running the territory:

1. Open [workspace.md](workspace.md) for the file map and canonical operator path.
2. Use the work-politics operator surface at **`/operator/pol`** (legacy **`/operator/wap`**) to see campaign status, blockers, work-politics gate items, content queue, and next actions in one place.
3. Refresh [brief-source-registry.md](brief-source-registry.md) before generating the weekly brief.
4. Generate a first-pass brief (includes **Â§0 Recency slice**):  
   `python scripts/generate_work_politics_weekly_brief.py -u grace-mar --start YYYY-MM-DD -o docs/skill-work/work-politics/weekly-brief-YYYY-MM-DD.md`  
   Then run the **live 7d/30d pass** and replace Â§0 with three dated bullets. Latest artifact: [weekly-brief-2026-03-09.md](weekly-brief-2026-03-09.md).
4b. **Daily horizon (work-politics + work-strategy):** `python scripts/generate_work_politics_daily_brief.py -u grace-mar -o docs/skill-work/work-strategy/daily-brief-$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md` â€” RSS from [work-strategy/daily-brief-config.json](../work-strategy/daily-brief-config.json), dual **W/S** scores, snapshot + [daily-brief-focus.md](../work-strategy/daily-brief-focus.md) + **Â§1c** [daily-brief-jiang-layer.md](../work-strategy/daily-brief-jiang-layer.md) (work-jiang hooks). See [work-strategy/daily-brief-template.md](../work-strategy/daily-brief-template.md). Use `--no-fetch` offline. Optional long-form themes: [work-strategy/external-tech-scan.md](../work-strategy/external-tech-scan.md) (not a fact source for public copy). Optional gate traceability: `jiang_ref` on [pol-candidate-template.md](pol-candidate-template.md).
5. Use [content-queue.md](content-queue.md) as the working queue for `@usa_first_ky`.
6. For full briefs, complete [weekly-brief-template.md](weekly-brief-template.md) **Â§7 Triangulation** using [analytical-lenses/](analytical-lenses/manifest.md).
7. Stage work-politics milestones through `RECURSION-GATE` when they should become audited continuity or Record-adjacent knowledge.

---

## Outreach operator path

Use this order when the work block is about learning which work-politics offer and buyer segment actually lands:

1. Open [outreach-workspace.md](outreach-workspace.md).
2. Choose one offer from [offers.md](offers.md).
3. Choose the lane: direct outreach to a likely buyer or partner-led outreach through a trusted intermediary.
4. Confirm one target segment or partner type in [target-registry.md](target-registry.md).
5. Pull one or two proof lines from [proof-ledger.md](proof-ledger.md).
6. Log actual outcomes in [outreach-funnel.md](outreach-funnel.md).
7. Log pushback and framing lessons in [objection-log.md](objection-log.md).

| **Opposition brief (living doc)** | Single doc: Gallrein (and others) bio, endorsements, spending, narrative lines, vulnerabilities. Agent updates when you request; keeps tracking in one place. | Added â€” [opposition-brief.md](opposition-brief.md) |
| **Weekly brief template** | Standard structure for â€œthis weekâ€ briefs (news, votes, opposition, social, key dates). Consistent format; you know what to expect. | Added â€” [weekly-brief-template.md](weekly-brief-template.md) |
| **Operator workspace** | One work-politics entrypoint for dashboard schema, source registry, content queue, and workflow rhythm. | Added â€” [workspace.md](workspace.md) |
| **Brief source registry** | Structured list of what feeds the weekly brief and what still needs refresh. | Added â€” [brief-source-registry.md](brief-source-registry.md) |
| **Content queue** | Structured X/content workflow for `@usa_first_ky` with `idea` â†’ `posted` status. | Added â€” [content-queue.md](content-queue.md) |
| **Message bank** | Approved or draft talking points by issue (war powers, Epstein, Trump opposition). Keeps X and briefs on-message; update via pipeline. | Optional â€” add when you want a single source of truth for lines. |
| **RECURSION-GATE sync** | Doc vs gate lanes, weekly rhythm, work-politics template â€” [Â§ Sync](#sync-with-recursion-gate), [pol-candidate-template.md](pol-candidate-template.md). | Added |
| **District context** | KY-4 basics: counties, demographics, local issues, local media. Improves district-focused messaging and briefs. | Optional â€” add when you want district one-pager. |
| **FEC / compliance reminders** | Tie calendar to reminders: 48-hour notices window, pre-primary report due. So we donâ€™t miss deadlines. | Optional â€” add to workflow-reminders or calendar. |
| **Debate prep (if primary debate)** | If KY-4 has a debate: date in calendar; one-pager for prep (opposition lines, principalâ€™s best answers) and post-debate (narrative, X angles). | Optional â€” add when debate is confirmed. |
| **Sources / monitoring list** | Curated list for briefs: local KY, national, FEC, Ballotpedia. Makes daily/weekly briefs more consistent. | Optional â€” add when you want a fixed source list. |
| **X content calendar** | Key dates when we might post (early vote, FEC, debate). Request drafts in advance. | Optional â€” can fold into calendar-2026 or account-x. |
| **Post-primary playbook (if Massie loses)** | Checklist: archive principal profile, lessons learned, criteria for â€œother candidates,â€ where to find races. Makes bifurcation actionable. | Optional â€” add closer to May 19 or after. |
