# work-politics workspace

Canonical operator entrypoint for the territory.

Use this file when you want one place to understand:

- current campaign state
- what is stale
- what is queued for X / content
- what sources feed the weekly brief
- how outreach is being framed and tracked
- what should stage to `RECURSION-GATE`

## Operating rhythm

1. **"We did X" â†’ stage** â€” After calls, readings, decisions, milestones, say "we did X" so the agent stages to RECURSION-GATE; the gate stays current. See [we-did-x-habit.md](../../we-did-x-habit.md).
2. Refresh `brief-source-registry.md` before the weekly brief.
3. Review `content-queue.md` before asking for post drafts.
4. Use the work-politics dashboard/operator surface for territory blockers and next actions.
5. Use `outreach-workspace.md` when the work block is about offer testing, proof, and buyer learning rather than campaign execution.
6. Stage work-politics milestones through `RECURSION-GATE` when something should become audited continuity or Record-adjacent knowledge.

## Guardrail

This workspace is a `WORK` surface. It does not create a second queue, and it does not change the gated merge rule.
