# Grace Gems (work-business)

**Objective:** Manage the Grace Gems Etsy business — custom fine jewelry with natural gemstones — across two storefronts:

| Shop | URL |
| --- | --- |
| GraceGemsUS | [etsy.com/shop/GraceGemsUS](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GraceGemsUS) |
| GioielloHandcrafted | [etsy.com/shop/GioielloHandcrafted](https://www.etsy.com/shop/GioielloHandcrafted) |

Market tag: [etsy.com/market/grace_gems](https://www.etsy.com/market/grace_gems)

**Singularity operating SSOT:** Recurring Etsy ops, listing review gate, margin/policy templates, and loop output shelves live at [`operations/grace-gems/`](../../../operations/grace-gems/README.md) — start with [STRATEGIC-PLAN.md](../../../operations/grace-gems/STRATEGIC-PLAN.md) and [listing review template](../../../operations/grace-gems/listings/review/listing-review-template.md). This work-business folder holds entity doctrine and long-form business context; loop artifacts land on the singularity shelf.

This submodule supports WORK and the Record by documenting how Grace-Mar relates to the companion's business: inventory, listings, customer service, orders, and operations. The companion is sovereign; the system supports, does not compel.

## Purpose

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Business context** | Document what Grace Gems does (product range, materials, policies) so the Record can inform Voice responses when the companion queries about the business. |
| **WORK integration** | Making, planning, execution, exchange — gemstones, jewelry creation, orders, customer interaction. Evidence (CREATE-, ACT-) can capture business milestones. |

Grace Gems (GraceGemsUS) sells customized fine jewelry with natural, untreated gemstones; solid 14k/18k gold; handmade in Denver. Products include emeralds, rubies, sapphires, tanzanite, moonstone, topaz, tourmaline, amethyst, opal, bridal sets. Policies: free worldwide shipping, 30-day returns (excl. custom), 1-year repair warranty, layaway. Companion-led; the Record holds business-relevant context when documented.

**Sovereignty framing:** Grace Gems aligns with companion-owned, local economy principles: natural provenance (untreated gemstones), handmade in Denver, policy-transparent, cash-friendly. The business models authenticity and local production as alternatives to homogenized, programmable commerce.

## Principles

1. **Companion sovereignty** — Business decisions (pricing, inventory, policies) are the companion's. The Record documents; it does not direct.
2. **Knowledge boundary** — Voice responses about the business use only what is documented in the Record (SELF, SKILLS, EVIDENCE). No LLM inference into business facts.
3. **Evidence-grounded** — Business milestones (new products, sales, feedback) enter the Record through the gated pipeline ("we did X" → stage → approve → merge).
4. **Integrate with WORK** — Grace Gems activities (making, planning, exchange) map to WORK container; CREATE- and ACT- evidence can capture business outcomes.
