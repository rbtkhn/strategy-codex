## 1. Market Research Summary

### 1.1 Etsy Jewelry Market (2024–2025)

| Metric | Finding |
|--------|---------|
| **Category size** | Jewelry/accessories: 16% seasonal growth (Nov–Dec). US jewelry market projected $121.78B by 2031 (5.8% CAGR). |
| **Etsy fine jewelry (gold)** | ~$200K–$350K weekly GMV, 400–700 unit sales. |
| **Etsy fine jewelry (diamond)** | ~$225K–$450K weekly GMV, 150–300 unit sales. |
| **Gemstone fine jewelry** | $200K–$350K weekly on Etsy; avg price band $350–$750. |
| **Custom** | Custom items remain bestsellers (name necklaces, birthstone rings). Custom engagement rings: 9/10 opportunity on Etsy. |
| **2025 style trends** | Galactic metallic, zodiac, pearl chokers, irregular petal, boho statement; custom and personalization strong. |

### 1.2 Natural vs Lab-Grown Positioning

- **Lab-grown diamonds:** ~14% of US jewelry market (2024); ~45% of US engagement ring purchases; $97B market by 2034 (14%+ CAGR). Online share ~60%; margins 60–70% vs 40–45% for natural.
- **Consumer preference (2025):** 74% would *accept* lab-grown; only 33% *prefer* lab-grown (down from 2023); 30% favor natural (up); 37% undecided. Natural is repositioning as “enduring value” and authenticity.
- **Grace Gems angle:** 100% natural, untreated gemstones is a clear differentiator. Natural benefits from heritage, authenticity, and emotional narrative; Grace Gems can lean on provenance (Mozambique, Sri Lanka, Zambia, Colombia, etc.) and craftsmanship (Denver, 14k/18k solid gold).

### 1.3 Seller Pain Points (Etsy Jewelry)

| Pain point | Impact | Source |
|------------|--------|--------|
| **Message volume** | 5–10 hrs/week on repetitive questions; delayed replies cost custom orders. | AgentiveAIQ, eDesk |
| **Response speed** | Fast responders ~3x more likely to convert; 75% abandon after 2–3 unanswered questions. | AgentiveAIQ |
| **Star Seller** | 95% of first messages replied within 24 hours required. | eDesk |
| **Negative reviews** | 62% cite poor customer service. Algorithm favors high engagement and fast reply. | AgentiveAIQ |
| **Custom + layaway** | Custom requests, private listings, 6–8 week processing; layaway = multi-payment tracking and reservation. | Alura, Etsy layaway listings |

## 3. Automation Integration Ideas (Grace-Mar Aligned)

Design principles: **companion sovereignty**, **gated pipeline**, **Record as context**, **handback for evidence**. Automation suggests and stages; companion approves. No autonomous merge into Record or autonomous business actions.

### 3.1 Etsy → Record Handback (Phase 1)

**Idea:** Ingest Etsy events (new order, new message, review, listing sold) and turn them into **staged candidates** for the Record, not auto-merge.

- **Flow:** Etsy webhook or poll (Receipt, Message, Review) → script normalizes event → analyst or rule-based stage → **RECURSION-GATE** → companion approves → merge into EVIDENCE (e.g. ACT- “order fulfilled”, “new 5-star review”) and optionally SELF (e.g. IX-A “Grace Gems has 916 reviews”).
- **Why Grace-Mar:** Business milestones become part of the Record only when the companion approves. “We did X” for the shop (e.g. “We hit 2,000 sales”) is evidence; handback keeps it one-way and gated.
- **Implementation sketch:** `scripts/etsy_handback.py` or similar: OAuth + poll Receipts/Messages/Reviews → emit synthetic “we did [X]” lines → call existing `analyze_activity_report` or stage to recursion-gate. No direct write to SELF/EVIDENCE.

### 3.2 Message Assist (Draft Only, No Send)

**Idea:** Use Record + Etsy context to **draft** replies to customer messages; companion edits and sends in Etsy.

- **Flow:** Companion (or operator) triggers “draft reply” with message thread ID. Script pulls message + listing/order context from Etsy API; builds prompt from Record (Grace Gems policies, tone, product range); LLM returns draft reply. Human copies into Etsy and sends.
- **Why Grace-Mar:** Reduces 5–10 hrs/week on repetitive answers while keeping **sending** in human hands. Knowledge boundary: draft uses only Record-documented policies and product info (no LLM hallucination of policies). Fits “structure + execution” (human provides final intent).
- **Implementation sketch:** Optional small “message assist” flow in bot or separate script: input = thread_id or message text; prompt = Record excerpt (policies, FAQ) + message; output = draft text. No Etsy write scope required for draft-only.

### 3.3 Listing → Record Sync (Read-Only or Staged Updates)

**Idea:** Periodically **read** Etsy listings (and optionally inventory) and either (a) expose them for operator review, or (b) stage “new listing” / “listing updated” as candidates for the Record.

- **Flow:** Etsy API list listings → diff with last snapshot or with Record-referenced set → produce “new/updated” list. Option A: report only (dashboard or file). Option B: for each new/updated listing, stage a candidate (“We added listing: [title]”) → recursion-gate → companion approves → merge into EVIDENCE.
- **Why Grace-Mar:** Keeps Record aligned with what’s actually for sale without automatic writes. Supports “what does Grace Gems offer?” answers from the Voice when documented.

### 3.4 Order & Receipt Summary for Operator

**Idea:** Daily or on-demand **summary** of orders/receipts (and optionally messages) for the operator, without writing to the Record unless the companion approves a “we did X” summary.

- **Flow:** Poll Receipts (and optionally Conversations); aggregate “today: N orders, M messages unread”; optional one-line per order (e.g. “Ruby studs, shipped”). Output: report (email, Telegram, or file). Companion can then say “we did [today’s summary]” and hand back to pipeline if they want it in the Record.
- **Why Grace-Mar:** Reduces cognitive load and keeps a single place (report) for “what happened today”; Record stays clean unless companion explicitly merges a summary.

### 3.5 Custom Order & Layaway Tracker (Internal Only)

**Idea:** Track custom orders and layaway payments **outside** the Record (e.g. local DB or sheet) and optionally feed **summaries** into handback.

- **Flow:** Operator (or future Etsy sync) logs custom request → private listing → payments. Tool shows “pending custom orders” and “layaway balance due.” No Etsy API for layaway payments (often off-API); manual or spreadsheet. Optional: “This week we completed 3 custom orders” → staged as candidate → merge into EVIDENCE on approval.
- **Why Grace-Mar:** Supports operations without putting sensitive order/payment detail in the Record; only high-level milestones enter via gate.

### 3.6 Voice Answers About the Business

**Idea:** When the companion asks the Voice about Grace Gems (e.g. “What does Grace Gems sell?”, “What’s our return policy?”), the Voice answers **only** from documented Record content.

- **Flow:** Already in scope: SELF or skill-work holds business profile (product range, policies). Voice reads from SYSTEM_PROMPT / retrieval. No new automation; requires **curating** business facts into the Record via pipeline (e.g. from market research or operator).
- **Why Grace-Mar:** Aligns with knowledge boundary; differentiator (natural gemstones, Denver-made, policies) is stated once in the Record and reused everywhere.

## 4. Prioritized Automation Roadmap (Suggested)

| Priority | Idea | Effort | Grace-Mar fit |
|----------|------|--------|----------------|
| **P0** | Etsy → Record handback (orders, reviews, key events as staged candidates) | Medium | High — evidence without auto-merge |
| **P1** | Order/receipt summary for operator (report only) | Low | High — no Record write |
| **P2** | Message assist (draft only; human sends) — **implemented** | Low | High — reduces load, keeps gate |
| **P3** | Listing sync (read; optional staged “new listing” candidates) | Medium | Medium — optional Record growth |
| **P4** | Custom/layaway tracker (internal; optional handback summary) | Medium | Medium — operational only |
| **P5** | Voice answers from Record (curate business platform/profile) | Low | High — already supported; add content |

---

## 5. Design Guardrails (All Ideas)

1. **No autonomous merge** — Etsy data can trigger staging only; companion approves before anything enters SELF or EVIDENCE.
2. **No autonomous send** — No sending Etsy messages, updating listings, or marking shipped without explicit human action (draft-only or human-in-loop).
3. **Knowledge boundary** — Any LLM-used business facts (policies, product range) must come from the Record and be gated.
4. **Credentials** — Etsy API keys and OAuth tokens are operator/companion managed; not in the Record; minimal scope (e.g. read-only where possible).
5. **Evidence only by approval** — “We hit 2,000 sales,” “We got a 5-star review” become ACT- or narrative evidence only after recursion-gate approval.
