# UPLOAD-PREP â€” work-cici bundle (forthcoming)

**Use when:** You are about to copy grace-mar **work-cici**-related material to **[Cici](https://github.com/Xavier-x01/Cici)** (or another Xavier-controlled repo / zip share).

**Advisor module stays canonical in grace-mar** â€” her repo gets **what she needs to run**, not a full mirror of `docs/skill-work/work-cici/`.

---

## 1) Choose upload scope

| Scope | What to copy | Typical destination |
|-------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Minimal (recommended default)** | Entire [`.cursor/skills/skill-cici/`](../../../.cursor/skills/skill-cici/) | `Cici/.cursor/skills/skill-cici/` |
| **Skill + activation line** | After copy, one line in her `CLAUDE.md` (or repo onboarding doc): daily learning log â†’ **skill-cici** **Mode B** | Same repo |
| **Advisor docs** | Full `docs/skill-work/work-cici/` | **Usually omit** â€” duplicates INDEX, runbooks, BrewMind pack; risks path confusion unless she explicitly maintains advisor docs in-tree |

**Link expectation:** `SKILL.md` links many paths under `docs/skill-work/work-cici/` and `scripts/` â€” those resolve in **grace-mar**. On Cici, **Mode B** (journal template, guardrails, `validate-governed-state.py`) still works; deep links are for mentor context or grace-mar checkout. See [Porting](../../../.cursor/skills/skill-cici/SKILL.md#porting-this-skill-to-cici) (trim **Mode A** if confusing).

---

## 2) Pre-flight (required)

- [ ] Read [LEAKAGE-CHECKLIST.md](LEAKAGE-CHECKLIST.md) â€” no stray `` identity, no Record merges without her gate, RAG/MCP â‰  approval.
- [ ] Search files you will ship: no accidental `` path strings (except explicit policy cites).
- [ ] No API keys, tokens, or credentialed URLs in shipped markdown.
- [ ] If you paste **journal** samples, scrub secrets; journal is WORK, not her Record.

---

## 3) skill-cici manifest (minimal upload)

Relative to grace-mar repo root:

```text
.cursor/skills/skill-cici/
â”œâ”€â”€ SKILL.md
â””â”€â”€ (any other files in that directory â€” include whole folder)
```

Verify:

```bash
ls -la .cursor/skills/skill-cici/
```

---

## 4) Optional: refresh grace-mar mirrors before / after the call

Upload to Cici does **not** require mirror files. If you are also aligning **advisor** materials in grace-mar, follow [SYNC-DAILY.md](SYNC-DAILY.md) and append [work-dev-mirror/SYNC-LOG.md](work-dev-mirror/SYNC-LOG.md) / [work-politics-mirror/SYNC-LOG.md](work-politics-mirror/SYNC-LOG.md) when you copy canonical cuts.

---

## 5) After upload lands

- [ ] Confirm she can follow **Mode B** steps (calendar day file, sections, governed-state validator when touching proposals/config).
- [ ] Log the event in the table below (and optionally one bullet under **Log** in [work-cici-history.md](work-cici-history.md)).
