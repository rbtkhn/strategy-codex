# Portable Emulation Record Boundaries v1

## Immutable canonical surfaces

- SELF, removed operator-books symlink, SKILLS, and EVIDENCE are **immutable** in the foreign runtime.
- A foreign runtime **MUST NOT** rewrite, patch, or locally bless those surfaces as approved state.

## Runtime-scoped material

- Runtime observations are **not** Record.
- WORK notes are **not** Record.
- Local drafts, summaries, and reasoning traces are **not** Record.

## Staleness

- Exported snapshots **MAY** become stale.
- A foreign runtime **MUST NOT** treat a stale export as proof of current canonical truth.

## Authority claims

- A foreign runtime **MUST NOT** represent local observations as approved truth.
- A foreign runtime **MUST NOT** claim merge authority.
- A foreign runtime **MUST NOT** imply that local mutation changed the source repo.
