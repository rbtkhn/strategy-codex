# SKILLS–TEMPLATE v2.0

Cognitive Emulator · Skills Module Governance Template

Status: ACTIVE
Version: 2.0
Last Update: February 2026

**Governed by**: [GRACE-MAR-CORE v2.0](grace-mar-core.md)

---

## I. PURPOSE

This template governs the SKILLS module of the cognitive fork.

The SKILLS module:
- Captures what the user CAN DO
- Grows through authentic activity (not explicit teaching)
- Provides queryable, verifiable capability evidence
- Tracks depth, not just breadth
- Preserves development trajectory over time

The SKILLS module is NOT:
- A curriculum
- A grading system
- A test score repository
- An automated assessment
- A teaching interface

SKILLS are demonstrated through real activity. The user DOES things;
Grace-Mar observes, records, and infers capability from accumulated evidence.

---

## II. THE RECORD-BOUND SKILL MODULES

**Formal specification:** Module set, boundaries, and the rule that Voice and written profile are functions of the Record (with skill-write as linguistic shaper) are specified in [SKILLS-MODULARITY](skills-modularity.md).

**Standard labels:** For APIs, docs, and cross-references use **self-skill-write** and **self-skill-think**. See [ID-TAXONOMY § Standard capability labels](id-taxonomy.md#standard-capability-labels-self-skill-).

SKILLS now organizes under **two Record-bound modules: THINK and WRITE**. These are the capability containers that describe what the companion can do **inside the Record**. They are evidence-linked, gated, and constrained by the Record's knowledge boundary.

**Split-template extensions:** The companion-self **`platform/template/`** scaffold may also ship **self-skill-work.md** (making/doing — not the same as operator **`docs/skill-work/`** territories) and **self-skill-steward.md** (**STEWARD** — governance literacy at the gate; not merge authority). See [skills-modularity.md](skills-modularity.md) §1–2 and [concept.md](concept.md) §4.

### II-A. Separate work / execution layer

**Operator work territories are not self-skill modules.** Execution and runbooks live in a separate layer (below). That is distinct from the optional **self-skill-work.md** *file* on the companion-self split template, which holds **Record-bound** project/making **capability** evidence — see [skills-modularity.md](skills-modularity.md). Work now lives in this execution layer:

- `docs/skill-work/work-*/` = reusable **work territories**
- `work-*.md` = instance **work contexts**

Work territories may use broader LLM capability, tools, APIs, and planning loops than the Record allows. They may produce artifacts, plans, and staged candidates. But they do **not** write Record truth directly, and they do **not** change SELF, EVIDENCE, or prompt without the same companion gate.

**Historical compatibility:** `BUILD` remains a legacy compatibility term in older docs and analyses. `CREATE-*` and `ACT-*` evidence IDs remain valid and are not renamed by this taxonomy refactor.

### II-B. Semi-Independent executor contract

THINK and WRITE may be implemented as semi-independent executors with separate prompts or strategies. They are capability-specialized components, not sovereign agents.

Constitutional constraints (mandatory):
- Stage-only: no executor may merge into canonical Record files.
- Evidence-linked output: every capability claim remains traceable.
- Knowledge boundary: no undocumented facts may be asserted as Record truth.
- User gate: conflicts between executors are resolved by user approval, not by executor arbitration.

Behavior shaping from SELF (three-dimension mind):
- IX-A Knowledge influences factual confidence and abstention thresholds.
- IX-B Curiosity influences exploration priority and query selection.
- IX-C Personality influences tone, framing, and interaction style.

Suggested default emphasis profile:

| Executor | Weight profile |
|----------|----------------|
| THINK | Curiosity > Knowledge > Personality |
| WRITE | Personality > Knowledge > Curiosity |

This profile is advisory and may be tuned per user while preserving the constitutional constraints above.

### WRITE (Production)

The user produces something. Grace-Mar captures and analyzes.

**Activities:**
- Daily journal entries
- Stories, creative writing
- Messages to friends/family
- Explanations, tutorials
- Essays, reports
- Lists, notes, plans
- Code, designs, diagrams

**What Grace-Mar captures:**
- Vocabulary (words used, range, sophistication)
- Sentence complexity (structure, length, variety)
- Narrative style (how they tell stories)
- Emotional expression (feelings, tone)
- Topics and interests (what they write about)
- Logical structure (argument, sequence)
- Growth trajectory (improvement over time)

**Example activity:**
> Student writes daily journal. Grace-Mar ingests each entry.
> After 30 days: vocabulary profile, style fingerprint, 
> topic map, emotional range, complexity baseline.

### THINK (Intake, Learning)

**Module intent:** THINK captures capability from evidence. When a work territory has horizon goals (e.g. SAT), THINK prioritizes content and assessments that move the companion toward those goals. Work contexts may read THINK state to measure progress.

The user consumes content. Grace-Mar tracks and assesses comprehension.
THINK is multimodal by default and must not be limited to text.

**Activities:**
- Books read (with summaries, reactions)
- Articles, stories consumed
- Videos watched (educational, entertainment)
- Podcasts, audiobooks
- Music listening (songs, classical pieces, performances)
- Images, diagrams, maps, and visual media
- Instructions followed
- Conversations (what they took in)

**What Grace-Mar captures:**
- Content consumed (what they read/watched)
- Input modality (`text`, `video`, `audio/music`, `image/diagram/map`, or `mixed`)
- Source or artifact reference (title, URL, file path, or media id)
- Comprehension (can they summarize, explain?)
- Inference (can they predict, conclude?)
- Vocabulary acquisition (new words learned)
- Interest patterns (what they choose)
- Difficulty level (what's challenging vs easy)
- Reading velocity (speed, volume)

**Example activity:**
> Student reads chapter book, tells Grace-Mar what happened.
> Grace-Mar captures: comprehension level, new vocabulary,
> character understanding, plot inference, emotional response.

**SAT readiness (when a work territory has SAT as a horizon goal):** Add optional `sat_readiness` block in `skill-think.md` — maps THINK/MATH/Lexile to SAT domains (EBRW Reading, Math), defines trajectory and next milestones. Use **general principles** (comprehension at edge, inference through "why?", vocabulary in context, evidence "what in the story shows that?", simple choices that scale) — developmentally appropriate at companion's level; no SAT-specific mechanics for young companions. Work territories may read this to measure progress. See grace-mar `skill-think.md` § SAT READINESS.

**Overlay rule for skill files:** The skill container itself should remain primary. Subject-specific material (for example math or Chinese inside THINK) may appear only as clearly labeled **contextual domain overlays** that show where the skill is being expressed, not as additional self-skills. Goal-linked material (for example SAT readiness) may appear only as clearly labeled **goal interpretation overlays** that help WORK read the skill state for horizon planning. In short: core capability first, overlays second.

**Compatibility note for the rest of this file:** Some deeper examples still use legacy `BUILD` terminology. Read those as historical compatibility examples for the separate work layer, not as proof that WORK remains a self-skill module.

---

## III. SKILL INTERACTIONS AND THE SELF

The Record-bound skill modules are not isolated. Most activities engage multiple surfaces, and some also touch the separate work layer.

| Activity | Primary | Secondary / adjacent |
|----------|---------|----------------------|
| Write a story | WRITE | THINK |
| Summarize a book | THINK | WRITE |
| Explain how something works | WRITE | THINK |
| Journal about the day | WRITE | — |
| Follow instructions to build | THINK | work layer |
| Run a campaign plan | work layer | WRITE |
| Class food truck project | work layer | THINK |
| Create content for audience | work layer | WRITE |
| Manage allowance, budget | work layer | — |
| Drawing, artwork, invention | work layer | THINK or WRITE, if evidenced |

**Tagging rule:** Tag the primary Record skill when the artifact demonstrates THINK or WRITE capability. Otherwise treat it as work-layer activity that may later produce evidence or staged candidates.

### Skill modules vs. self (IX-A/B/C)

**Skill modules (THINK, WRITE) update only capability** — comprehension and production. They do *not* extract or write knowledge, curiosity, or personality into SELF.

**The analyst** (see ARCHITECTURE, pipeline) extracts patterns for **self-knowledge (IX-A), curiosity (IX-B), and personality (IX-C)** from the same inputs and stages candidates to RECURSION-GATE → SELF after companion approval.

So **one input** (e.g. art, music, journal, conversation, work artifact) can update both: (1) a Record skill container (THINK/WRITE) when it demonstrates Record-bound capability, and (2) SELF (IX-A/B/C) via analyst-staged candidates. Work-layer activity may also stage evidence or candidates, but it does not become a self-skill automatically. The analyst serves SELF; the skill modules serve SKILLS.

**Personality boundary:** SKILLS may reveal tone, affect, follow-through, collaboration posture, or aesthetic tendency, but those are not canonical personality truth until they are staged and approved into IX-C.

**Identity vs capability rule:** If a claim answers **who the companion is / how they come across**, it belongs to SELF. If it answers **what the companion can reliably do / how well / with what support**, it belongs to SKILLS. The same artifact may justify both paths, but the two surfaces should not pretend to be doing the same job.

**Linguistic overlap rule:** A recurring language habit may appear in both places when:

- SELF records it as expressive style or Voice-facing feel
- WRITE records it as demonstrated production behavior or current writing range

When in doubt, let EVIDENCE anchor the artifact, SELF own identity, and WRITE own capability.

---

## IV. SKILLS PHASE MODEL

All SKILLS operate within one of three phases.

### PHASE I — BUILDING (Default)

The user is actively building this skill through interaction.

Characteristics:
- Knowledge is accumulating
- Depth is increasing
- No formal verification required
- Record reflects what has been demonstrated

Permitted:
- Free teaching
- Exploration
- Mistakes and corrections
- Inconsistencies (user is learning)

### PHASE II — MILESTONE

A verification checkpoint has been reached.

Triggers:
- User declares "I know this now"
- Parent/teacher attests competence
- Threshold criteria met (e.g., 5+ teaching sessions)
- External verification (proctored demonstration)

Characteristics:
- Knowledge claim is formalized
- Verification level assigned
- Snapshot of current understanding
- Gaps explicitly identified

### PHASE III — ARCHIVED

Historical record of knowledge at a point in time.

Characteristics:
- Read-only
- Preserved as part of trajectory
- May be superseded by later learning
- Cannot be modified, only annotated

---

## III. CAPABILITY CLAIMS

Capability Claims are formal statements about what the user can do,
derived from accumulated activity evidence across the Record-bound modules. Historical `BUILD` examples below are compatibility artifacts for older work evidence and analyses; they do not redefine WORK as a current self-skill.

Analogous to CMC's Recursive Learning Ledger (RLL): activities feed capability claims; claims accumulate; the Record improves over time. See [PIPELINE-MAP](pipeline-map.md#recursive-learning-process) for the full recursive learning definition.

### Capability Claim Structure

```typescript
interface CapabilityClaim {
  id: string;                    // CAP-WRITE-VOC-001
  module: 'WRITE' | 'THINK';
  dimension: string;             // "vocabulary", "comprehension", "originality"
  statement: string;             // "Uses age-appropriate vocabulary with variety"
  
  // Level
  level: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5;     // Developmental level
  
  // Verification
  verification_level: VerificationLevel;
  confidence_tier: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4;
  
  // Temporal
  first_demonstrated: Date;
  last_confirmed: Date;
  activity_count: number;        // Number of activities showing this

## VII. MODULE STRUCTURE

SKILLS organize under the two Record-bound modules. Work contexts remain adjacent and may have their own internal dimensions, but they are not part of the self-skill set.

### Structure

```
SKILLS/
├── WRITE/
│   ├── vocabulary/           # Words used, range, sophistication
│   ├── complexity/           # Sentence structure, variety
│   ├── style/                # Narrative voice, tone
│   ├── expression/           # Emotional content, feeling
│   ├── topics/               # What they write about
│   ├── logic/                # Argument, sequence, structure
│   └── growth/               # Trajectory over time
│
├── THINK/
│   ├── comprehension/        # Understanding what was consumed
│   ├── inference/            # Conclusions beyond explicit
│   ├── vocabulary/           # Words acquired
│   ├── interests/            # What they choose to read
│   ├── difficulty/           # Level of challenge handled
│   ├── velocity/             # Speed, volume
│   └── content_log/          # What they've read
│
└── (work contexts are separate)

work-context/
├── planning/                # Goals, timelines, milestones
├── execution/               # Follow-through, deliverables
├── customer_audience/       # Who to serve, feedback
├── financial/               # Money concepts, P&L, budgeting
├── collaboration/           # Teamwork, delegation, roles
├── decision_making/         # Trade-offs, prioritization
└── creative_context/        # Originality, elaboration, flexibility, style
```

### Subject Knowledge

Traditional subjects (math, science, history) are NOT separate modules.
They are CONTEXTS where THINK/WRITE are applied, and where work territories may also operate as adjacent execution surfaces.

**Example: Math**
- THINK: Understands math concepts, can interpret problems
- WRITE: Can produce correct solutions, explain reasoning
- Work layer: Can solve novel problems, find patterns

**Example: History**
- THINK: Knows historical events, can summarize periods
- WRITE: Can explain historical cause/effect
- Work layer: Can reason about counterfactuals ("what if...")

Subject knowledge emerges from evidence across THINK, WRITE, and approved evidence connected to work activity. Work starts from live execution context; it does not become Record truth without evidence and approval.

---

## VIII. DEPENDENCY MAPPING

Track prerequisites and unlocks.

### Prerequisite Chains

```
VKC-MATH-0001 (Counting)
    └── VKC-MATH-0002 (Addition)
        └── VKC-MATH-0003 (Subtraction)
            └── VKC-MATH-0004 (Multiplication)
                └── VKC-MATH-0005 (Division)
                    └── VKC-MATH-0006 (Fractions)
```

### Why This Matters

- Validates knowledge claims (can't know division without multiplication)
- Identifies gaps (missing prerequisite = likely struggle)
- Enables intelligent querying ("what should they learn next?")
- Detects suspicious patterns (advanced without basics)

---

## IX. INCONSISTENCY HANDLING

When new teaching contradicts previous teaching.

Adapted from CMC's Anomaly Flag Protocol.

### Inconsistency Types

| Type | Meaning | Resolution |
|------|---------|------------|
| GROWTH | Student learned/changed | Update, preserve history |
| ERROR | One session was wrong | Flag, seek clarification |
| CONTEXT | Both true in different contexts | Preserve both with context |
| RETRACTION | Student explicitly retracts | Archive old, note retraction |

### Inconsistency Format

```
INCONSISTENCY FLAG

ID: INC-001
Previous: "2 + 2 = 5" (Session 042)
Current: "2 + 2 = 4" (Session 067)
Type: ERROR → GROWTH
Resolution: Student corrected error after learning
Action: Update VKC, preserve history
```

### Principle

Do NOT silently reconcile. Preserve the tension.
Let the user's learning journey be visible.

---

## X. SNAPSHOTS

Preserve skills at points in time.

### Snapshot Triggers

- Age milestones (6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18)
- Grade transitions
- Major life events (moving, changing schools)
- On-demand (operator/user request)

### Snapshot Format

```
SKILLS–SNAPSHOT–[NAME]–AGE–[X]

Created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
Status: ARCHIVED

SUMMARY:
- Total VKCs: [count]
- Domains active: [list]
- Strongest domain: [domain]
- Current focus: [what they're learning now]

DOMAIN BREAKDOWN:
[For each active domain]
- VKC count: [n]
- Depth range: [1-3] to [3-5]
- Verification levels: [breakdown]

NOTABLE SKILLS:
- [Top 5 VKCs with highest depth/verification]

ACTIVE GAPS:
- [Current knowledge gaps]

LEARNING VELOCITY:
- [How fast they're acquiring skills]
```

### Preservation Rule

Snapshots are IMMUTABLE. They preserve who the user was.
Later learning does not modify snapshots.

---

## XI. CONTAINER EDGE TEACHING

The Record-bound skill modules are CONTAINERS that define current capability boundaries. The system proposes Record-facing activities at the EDGE. Work contexts may also have edges, but they are separate from the self-skill container model.

### Container State

Each module has a current boundary:

```
THINK Container:
├── Vocabulary: ~800 words (level 3)
├── Comprehension: chapter books (level 3)
├── Inference: basic predictions (level 2)
└── EDGE: longer books, 1-2 new words per session

WRITE Container:
├── Vocabulary: ~400 active words (level 2)
├── Complexity: simple sentences (level 2)
├── Expression: strong (level 3)
└── EDGE: compound sentences, connectors

Adjacent work context:
├── Creative context: familiar recombinations, moderate detail
├── Planning context: simple steps for small projects
└── EDGE: clearer sequencing, stronger originality, longer chains
```

### Teaching at the Edge

| Zone | Description | System behavior |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Inside | Already knows/can do | Use as foundation, reference |
| Edge | Just beyond current | Propose activities here (optimal) |
| Outside | Too advanced | Don't go here yet |

### Gap vs Edge

**Gap:** Something INSIDE the container that's missing
- Fill gaps BEFORE extending edge
- Example: Can read but can't summarize → fill gap

**Edge:** The BOUNDARY of current capability
- Extend after gaps are filled
- Example: Ready for slightly harder books

### Implementation

When the system proposes activities or interacts:

1. Check container state (levels, gaps)
2. Use vocabulary FROM container (grounding)
3. Introduce concepts AT edge (growth)
4. Fill gaps before extending (foundations)
5. Never jump outside container (frustration)

## XII. QUERYING SKILLS

How evaluators interact with the SKILLS module.

### Pillar Queries

**WRITE capability:**
> "How well does [user] write?"
> Returns: Levels across vocabulary, complexity, style, expression, logic

**THINK capability:**
> "How well does [user] comprehend?"
> Returns: Levels across comprehension, inference, vocabulary acquisition

**Work context summary:**
> "What planning/creation/work evidence exists for [user]?"
> Returns: approved evidence and work-context observations, not a self-skill container score

### Cross-Module Queries

**Overall profile:**
> "What are [user]'s cognitive strengths?"
> Returns: Module comparison, strongest dimensions

**Demonstration:**
> "Show me how [user] would explain [topic]"
> Returns: Record data + SELF context (optional emulation if enabled)

**Trajectory:**
> "How has [user]'s writing developed?"
> Returns: WRITE module growth over time, milestones, struggles

**Gap analysis:**
> "Where should [user] focus development?"
> Returns: Lowest dimensions, limited-evidence areas, struggles

### Example Query Responses

```
Query: "How well does [user] write?"

WRITE CAPABILITY PROFILE

Vocabulary:     ████████░░  Level 4 (Proficient)
Complexity:     ██████░░░░  Level 3 (Competent)
Style:          ███████░░░  Level 3.5 (Developing)
Expression:     █████████░  Level 4.5 (Strong)
Topics:         ████████░░  Level 4 (Varied)
Logic:          █████░░░░░  Level 2.5 (Developing)

Summary: Strong emotional expression and vocabulary;
logical organization is current growth area.

## XII. VERSIONING

### Version Control

- All Capability Claims are versioned
- Activities are immutable once captured
- Changes are timestamped
- History is preserved
- Deletions are not permitted (only archival)

### Audit Trail

Every modification to SKILLS must record:
- What changed
- When it changed
- Why it changed (activity reference, attestation, etc.)
- Previous value (preserved)

## XIII. INTEGRATION WITH SELF

SKILLS and SELF interact bidirectionally, but **through analyst interpretation and the gate**, not by direct writes from the skill containers. WRITE is the primary source of language evidence for SELF. THINK and work activity can also surface SELF-relevant signals, but canonical identity remains staged and approved.

### SELF → SKILLS (Prediction)

- Interests (SELF) predict which modules develop fastest
- Reasoning patterns (SELF) can shape work style and project choices in adjacent work contexts

### SKILLS → SELF (Inference)

**WRITE activities can surface SELF signals through analyst staging:**

| WRITE dimension | Possible SELF signal surfaced |
|-----------------|-------------------------------|
| vocabulary | linguistic_style range and level |
| complexity | sentence-pattern observations |
| style | tone, verbal habits, `IX-C` style markers |
| expression | emotional or interpersonal patterns staged to `IX-C` when identity-relevant |
| topics | interests and curiosity signals |
| content | linguistic_style samples and evidence-linked examples |

**Pipeline:**
```
Journal Entry → WRITE Analysis → analyst reviews identity signals → RECURSION-GATE
                    │
                    └── WRITE capability claims updated
```

### The THINK → SELF Pipeline

**THINK activities can surface SELF signals through analyst staging:**

| THINK data | Possible SELF signal surfaced |
|-----------|-------------------------------|
| content chosen | interests and curiosity topics |
| genres preferred | preferences.favorites |
| themes returned to | values or value expressions |
| emotional reactions | `IX-C` emotional patterns when evidenced |
| re-reads | recurring taste or attachment patterns |

**Example:**
```
THINK Activity: Finished "Charlotte's Web" (2nd read)
    │
    └── Possible staged signals:
        ├── interests: animals, farm life, friendship
        ├── preferences.favorites.books: "Charlotte's Web"
        ├── values: loyalty, sacrifice
        └── IX-C: recurring attachment to tender friendship stories
```

### Work Activity → SELF

- Planning/collaboration style → possible reasoning or interpersonal observations
- Financial/values signals → possible values or value-expression candidates
- Execution approach → possible `IX-C` personality candidates (e.g. follow-through)
- Creative content (artwork, inventions) → possible interests, aesthetic tendencies, or curiosity signals

### Key Insight

WRITE is both:
1. A skill module (capability to produce)
2. The primary language evidence source for SELF (how they express themselves)

The linguistic fingerprint lives in SELF but is derived from WRITE through analyst interpretation and approved Record updates.

### Query Requiring Both

> "Write a journal entry the way [user] would."

Uses: SELF.linguistic_style (derived from WRITE) + SELF.interests + WRITE.topics
