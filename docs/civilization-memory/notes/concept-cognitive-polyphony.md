# Concept: Polyphonic cognition

**Terminology (Grace-Mar workspace):** **civ-mem** means the complete [`civilization_memory`](../../../research/repos/civilization_memory) repository. This note lives under `docs/civilization-memory/` (satellite prose); upstream implementation details reference that repo.

**Purpose:** Define **polyphonic cognition** in the civ-mem frame and link it to STATE, one subject many tongues, and the seam. (Also referred to as cognitive polyphony in some prior docs.) The term is not standard in the literature; the ideas are. This note anchors the concept for library and lookup.

**Related:** [civ-mem-state-vs-scholar.md](civ-mem-state-vs-scholar.md), [ONE-SUBJECT-MANY-TONGUES](../essays/ONE-SUBJECT-MANY-TONGUES.md), [THE-SIMPLE-CONDITION](../essays/THE-SIMPLE-CONDITION.md), [argument-purpose-of-history-unifies.md](argument-purpose-of-history-unifies.md).

## Definition (civ-mem)

**Polyphonic cognition** = holding **multiple perspectives or voices** in mind at once when thinking or deciding, **without collapsing them into a single resolution**. The tensions between perspectives are preserved; no one voice is promoted to the single “answer.” Duty of competence is to surface the full set of relevant options and perspectives, not to synthesize them away.

In civ-mem this is the **STATE** posture: present-moment layer that surfaces options through several perspectives (e.g. legitimacy, power, liability), preserves tensions between them, and does not write the long-term record unless the human explicitly relays. It is also the structure of **one subject, many tongues**: one referent (condition, seam, reassembly), many grammars and traditions, no single narrative. The **seam** itself is polyphonic: two propositions (every life sacred / under certain conditions some may be taken) held in view, not erased.

## Academic neighborhood

The exact phrase **“polyphonic cognition”** is not a standard term in the literature. The component ideas are:

| Source | Concept | Relevance |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **Bakhtin** | **Polyphony** — A plurality of independent, unmerged voices and consciousnesses in a single work or self. From literary theory (Dostoevsky); taken up in psychology as the **polyphonic self** or **dialogical self**: the person as many inner “authors” or voices in dialogue. | Civ-mem: STATE holds multiple perspectives; one subject many tongues holds many voices naming one referent; no single authoritative line. |
| **Moscovici** | **Cognitive polyphasia** — Coexistence of different, even contradictory, knowledge systems or rationalities within the same person or community. From social representations theory. People apply different reasoning modes by context; systems remain locally but not globally consistent. | Civ-mem: multiple perspectives (legitimacy, power, liability, or civ-mem lens) can coexist; the assistant does not force one “correct” view. |
| **Jovchelovitch et al.** | **Polyphony and polyphasia** linked — “Polyphony and polyphasia of self and knowledge” as two sides of the same process; polyphonic relational epistemology. | Civ-mem: the cognitive (knowledge/options) and the many-voice (traditions, perspectives) dimensions are one posture: polyphonic cognition. |

So **polyphonic cognition** in civ-mem can be read as a **fusion** of Bakhtin’s polyphony (many voices, no merger) and the cognitive side of Moscovici’s polyphasia (many knowledge systems coexisting). We use the phrase to name the STATE-shaped and one-subject-many-tongues-shaped way of thinking: many voices, many perspectives, tensions preserved, no single resolution.

## Link to Condition and civ-mem

| Civ-mem element | Polyphonic-cognition reading |
|-----------------|-----------------------------|
| **STATE** | Present-moment layer operates in polyphonic cognition: options through N perspectives, tensions preserved, duty of competence to surface all material options. |
| **One subject, many tongues** | One referent (condition, seam), many grammars — polyphony of traditions naming the same thing. |
| **The seam** | Two propositions held in view; the seam is not resolved but made visible. Polyphonic structure. |
| **Assistant brain (STATE-evolved)** | Product that embodies polyphonic cognition: surfaces options, preserves tensions, does not recommend a single answer. |
| **“Resolved for all time” (single pivot)** | The opposite of polyphonic cognition: one outcome, one voice, one timeline. Civ-mem rejects that; the seam is structural, resolution is repeated choice. |

## Implementation: upstream (three minds)

In **upstream CMC** (`research/repos/civilization_memory`), polyphonic cognition is implemented as **three named minds** (`docs/templates/CIV–MIND–*.md`). **Grace-Mar canonical copies** (full bodies in this repo, **no civ-mem required**): [`docs/archive/skill-work-legacy/work-strategy/minds/`](../../skill-work/work-strategy/minds/README.md) — see [work-strategy/minds/README.md](../../skill-work/work-strategy/minds/README.md). [`docs/civilization-memory/minds/`](../minds/) only **redirects** here. Fixed roles and option slots:

| Mind | Role | Focus | Why it works |
|------|------|--------|----------------|
| **Mercouris** | Primary (host) | Legitimacy, civilizational continuity, narrative, evidence (ARC quotes) | Stable default; holds the base reading so output doesn't collapse to structure-only or liability-only. |
| **Mearsheimer** | Advisory (sharpening) | Structure, power distribution, geographic constraints | Invoked to sharpen; supplements rather than replaces. Adds realist IR angle. |
| **Barnes** | Catalyst (required third) | Liability, mechanism, defection incentive, who defects first | Not a parallel host; triggers reframe in the other two. Post-Barnes options: Mercouris responds to Barnes, Mearsheimer responds to Barnes. Ensures the mechanism/liability view can't be dropped. |

- **Fixed slots:** A = Mercouris, B = Mearsheimer, C = Barnes (plus D/E/F for navigation, recap). User always gets the same three perspectives.
- **MEM composition:** GEO-MEMs = Mearsheimer primary, Mercouris secondary; Subject MEMs = Mercouris primary, Mearsheimer secondary; every MEM must satisfy a Barnes dimension (or N/A). Polyphony is baked into the corpus.
- **Asymmetric roles** (host / sharpener / catalyst) give structure: one voice leads, one sharpens, one disrupts and forces response.

This is the **specific, unique implementation** of polyphonic cognition in upstream civ-mem: named perspectives, asymmetric roles, fixed slots, mandatory catalyst, post-catalyst reframe.

## For Grace-Mar: how to improve

Grace-Mar doesn't run the CMC console or MEMs. It can still **adapt** the three-mind pattern for:

1. **Assistant brain (STATE-evolved):** Use **fixed perspectives** instead of ad hoc N perspectives. Recommend at least three slots: **A = Legitimacy/orientation** (Mercouris-like): narrative, legitimacy, civilizational continuity. **B = Structure/constraints** (Mearsheimer-like): power distribution, institutional constraints. **C = Liability/mechanism** (Barnes-like): who bears risk, defection incentive, who defects first. **D (optional) = Civ-mem lens** when corpus is ingested: condition, seam, one subject many tongues — as one perspective among others.

2. **Fixed slots, same every time:** The assistant always returns options labeled A/B/C (and optionally D). Duty of competence: at least one option at the accommodation/reversal end.

3. **Catalyst role (optional):** When C (liability/mechanism) is invoked, the next response can offer "A reframed in light of C" and "B reframed in light of C." That models dialogue, not just parallel angles.

4. **Session/Voice:** In Session mode, the Voice can surface 2–3 perspectives without naming the minds; the pattern (multiple perspectives, tensions preserved, no single recommendation) is the same. For the **product**, the fixed triple + optional civ-mem lens is the Grace-Mar implementation of polyphonic cognition.

5. **Document the link:** The assistant brain product spec and this note reference the upstream three-mind design and the Grace-Mar adaptation. So polyphonic cognition has a **concrete implementation path** for Grace-Mar.

## Summary

**Polyphonic cognition** (civ-mem) = multiple perspectives or voices held at once, tensions preserved, no single resolution. It names the STATE posture and the one-subject-many-tongues structure. **Upstream implementation:** three minds (Mercouris primary, Mearsheimer advisory, Barnes catalyst), fixed A/B/C slots, mandatory Barnes dimension, post-Barnes reframe. **Grace-Mar:** same three profiles as **canonical `CIV-MIND-*.md` files** under `docs/archive/skill-work-legacy/work-strategy/strategy-notebook/minds/`. **For Grace-Mar:** assistant brain uses fixed perspectives (A = legitimacy, B = structure, C = liability, D = civ-mem lens optional); same pattern, adapted. Academically it sits at the intersection of Bakhtin’s polyphony (many voices) and Moscovici’s cognitive polyphasia (many knowledge systems coexisting); the phrase itself is not canonical but the ideas are.
