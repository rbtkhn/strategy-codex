# Operator Brief â€” Grace-Mar

For the operator or facilitator (e.g. parent, guardian, or family member) of the companion.

---

## What is Grace-Mar?

A **cognitive emulator** is a system the user teaches. Unlike typical apps that teach the user, this one learns *from* them. Over time it becomes a **interpretive machine** â€” a versioned record of how they think, what they know, and who they are, growing independently from a snapshot in time.

The companion is the teacher. The system only grows through their activity.

---

## First Session: Seed Survey

The first session is a short survey to get to know the companion. Four questions:

1. What are your favorite movies or shows?
2. What are your favorite books or stories?
3. What are your favorite places?
4. What are your favorite games?

**Duration:** ~10â€“15 minutes (adjust for attention and context)

**Who should be present:** Operator + companion. The companion answers; the operator can help prompt, rephrase, or type if needed.

---

## How We Capture Responses

- **Typing:** Operator types while the companion answers (recommended when the companion is young or prefers not to type)
- **Voice:** If using voice, responses are transcribed afterward
- **Relaxed:** No wrong answers. Partial or silly answers are fine â€” they all inform the profile.

---

## Consent

- Guardian/operator consent is required when the companion is a minor
- The companion may stop at any time
- You may request full deletion of all data at any time
- Milestone re-consent at ages 13, 16, 18 (per GRACE-MAR-CORE) when the companion is a minor

---

## What Gets Stored

- Survey responses â†’ SELF.preferences (favorites)
- Future sessions â†’ Reading list, writing samples, creations
- Everything is stored in a private GitHub repository; no third-party sharing without explicit permission

---

## Your Role: Co-Learner, Not Just Supervisor

Position yourself as a **co-learner** with the companion. AI evolves quickly; you may not have more expertise than they do. Instead of only supervising, embrace open-minded, transparent conversations. Explore the bot together, ask questions together, and be willing to navigate the space alongside them through trial, error, and adjustments.

---

## Contextual stewardship

- **New agent threads have no institutional memory.** You hold load-bearing context (tacit boundaries, what must not enter the Record). Truth is **files in the repo** plus what passed **RECURSION-GATE** â€” not a modelâ€™s recall of prior chats.
- **Judgment gets encoded** in the pipeline: staged candidates, merge receipts, pipeline events, and **tests** (integrity, counterfactual harness when prompts change) â€” not longer prompts alone.
- **Warmup output and briefs** orient you; when something matters, read **`recursion-gate.md`** and related files â€” do not treat a summary as authority.

---

## The "We did X" Ritual â€” Recognition & Accountability

When something worth recording happens (a drawing, a story, something learned, a new interest), the operator or companion sends a message that starts with **"we"** and an activity verb. The bot treats it as an activity report, stages candidates to the review queue, and the companion approves what enters the Record.

**Why it matters:** "We did X" is the main way the Record grows. It creates recognition (the companion sees their activity reflected), celebration (Grace-Mar acknowledges it), and accountability (review queue stays current). Treat it as a first-class habit, not an extra feature.

**How:** In Telegram, send e.g. *We drew a volcano today* or *We read The Wild Robot*. Then type **/review** to see whatâ€™s waiting; approve or reject each item. If you run the pipeline yourself, process the queue after approvals (see [OPERATOR-WEEKLY-REVIEW](operator-weekly-review.md)).

**Before each session:** Consider whether something since last time deserves a "we did X." After the session, run **/review** if anything was added.

---

## Session continuity & RECURSION-GATE

Keep the loop closed so the Record and the review queue stay in sync.

- **Safety story (not â€œtrust the chatâ€):** Comfort comes from **visible state** â€” whatâ€™s **pending** vs **approved**, **merge receipts**, **last evidence / merge** â€” and knowing **OpenClaw only stages** until the companion approves. Same fear class as silent prod drift; treat **audit continuity** as a primary story. See [safety-story-ux.md](skill-work/work-dev/safety-story-ux.md).

- **Before each session:** Skim SESSION-LOG and **RECURSION-GATE** (or run `python3 scripts/session_brief.py -u grace-mar` for a short brief, or `python3 scripts/operator_blocker_report.py -u grace-mar` for a fuller blocker report â€” includes **stale pending** so old candidates donâ€™t sit forever). Note how many candidates are waiting.
- **Three-tier traffic (review depth):** Tier 1 = quick-merge eligible (narrow: **museum knowledge section A/B/C `profile_target`**, see [recursion-gate-three-tier.md](recursion-gate-three-tier.md)); Tier 2 = normal gate review; Tier 3 = gate-heavy escalation vs **change-review** queue. This is **how hard you look**, not which folder the YAML lives in.
- **work-politics vs companion lens:** Pending split by territory â€” **`--territory work-politics`** (aliases `wap`, `wp`) = work-politics only (`territory: work-politics` or `channel_key: operator:wap` on the YAML); **`--territory companion`** = companion Record only. Same on `session_brief`, `harness_warmup`, `operator_blocker_report`. Default `all` shows both sections in the blocker report. **Orthogonal to tiers:** territory filters **which batch** merges; tiers describe **fast vs normal vs escalated review** â€” same candidate can be Tier 2 and work-politics.
- **Lookup usage (optional):** `python3 scripts/report_lookup_sources.py -u grace-mar` â€” shows whether Voice lookups used library vs full prompt (what actually gets used, not raw model capability).
- **Minimal brief:** `python3 scripts/session_brief.py -u grace-mar --minimal` â€” pending count + IDs + last activity + next action + recovery links. Add `--territory work-politics` or `companion` to filter.
- **Compact brief (CEL):** `python3 scripts/session_brief.py -u grace-mar --compact` â€” same as minimal plus operator-runtime tier hints from `platform/config/context_surfaces.json`. Doctrine: [skill-work/context-efficiency-layer.md](skill-work/context-efficiency-layer.md).
- **Duplicate-ish pending (optional):** `python3 scripts/pending_dedup_hint.py -u grace-mar` â€” flags pairs with similar summaries (merge one or reject).
- **Intent before approve (AI safety posture):** Three quick questions â€” (1) What would I *not* want merged even if it looks fine? (2) When must we stop and ask the companion? (3) If this conflicts with **INTENT**, companion wins. See [design-notes Â§11.9](design-notes.md#119-misalignment-at-the-interface--optimization-intent-gap-operator-leverage).
- **Rejection as skill:** Say **no** to candidates or Voice behavior that "looks right" but isnâ€™t grounded â€” **reject** in RECURSION-GATE; if Voice missed, **`calibrate_from_miss`** ([feedback-loops](feedback-loops.md)). Articulating *why* turns taste into something the pipeline can reuse. See [design-notes Â§11.10](design-notes.md#1110-rejection-as-skill--recognition-articulation-encoding).
- **Verify loop (harness convergence):** Big labs converged on **decompose â†’ verify â†’ iterate**. Your role is **sniff check** before merge â€” same as Cursorâ€™s judge, not the raw chat turn. See [design-notes Â§11.11](design-notes.md#1111-harness-convergence--decompose-parallelize-verify-iterate).
- **After the session:** If anyone sent "we did X" or you added activities, run **/review** in the bot (or process the queue per [OPERATOR-WEEKLY-REVIEW](operator-weekly-review.md)) so items donâ€™t sit in RECURSION-GATE for long.

Full checklist and weekly rhythm: [OPERATOR-WEEKLY-REVIEW](operator-weekly-review.md).

## Where is the Record? How does SELF-ARCHIVE get updated?

**Where to find the Record**

All instance files live in the repo under **``**. The Record itself is:

| File | What it is |
|------|------------|
| **self.md** | Who the companion is â€” identity, preferences, interests, knowledge (museum knowledge section A), curiosity (museum knowledge section B), personality (museum knowledge section C). |
| **self-skills.md** | What the Record can show they can do â€” THINK and WRITE capability and edges (legacy `skills.md` still resolved). |
| **self-evidence.md** | Activity log â€” ACT-*, WRITE-*, CREATE-* entries; raw evidence the Record is built on. |
| **recursion-gate.md** | **Multi-channel staging** (Telegram, WeChat, operator, tests â€” see each rowâ€™s `channel_key`). One queue per user; **nothing is in the Record until you approve and merge.** |
| **session-transcript.md** | Raw conversation log (every message), for operator continuity. Not part of the Record. |
| **self-archive.md** | Gated log of **approved** activity only â€” the conversation that made it into the Record. |

So: **Record = SELF + SKILLS + EVIDENCE** (and whatâ€™s reflected in the bot prompt). **RECURSION-GATE** is the gate. **SELF-ARCHIVE** is the approved-activity log.

**Why SELF-ARCHIVE isnâ€™t updating**

SELF-ARCHIVE is **not** written in real time. It is updated **only when you merge approved candidates**. The bot and analyst do this:

1. **Conversation** â†’ Bot replies; analyst may detect a â€œsignalâ€ (new knowledge, curiosity, personality).
2. **Staging** â†’ That becomes a **candidate** in RECURSION-GATE (you saw â€œANALYST: signal detected - staged candidateâ€ in the log).
3. **Your step** â†’ You open RECURSION-GATE, approve (or reject) each candidate, then tell the assistant **"approve"**. The agent immediately merges â€” one gate. Only then does the script write to SELF, EVIDENCE, SESSION-LOG, the bot prompt, **and append to SELF-ARCHIVE**.

**How to get SELF-ARCHIVE to update (short version)**

1. Open **`recursion-gate.md`** (or your user id).
2. In the **Candidates** section, for each block you want to keep: change `status: pending` to **`status: approved`** (or `rejected` to skip).
3. Tell the assistant **â€œapproveâ€** â€” it immediately processes. Or run:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/process_approved_candidates.py --user grace-mar --generate-receipt /tmp/receipt.json --approved-by "Your Name"
   python3 scripts/process_approved_candidates.py --user grace-mar --apply --approved-by "Your Name" --receipt /tmp/receipt.json
   **work-politics-only batch:** same commands with `--territory work-politics` on both steps (only merges candidates tagged work-politics; companion queue untouched).
   ```
4. After the merge, **SELF-ARCHIVE** is appended with the approved exchange(s); SELF, EVIDENCE, and the bot prompt are updated too.

**Gated commits (optional hardening):** If you use pre-commit with `pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg`, any commit that stages SELF, EVIDENCE, prompt, PRP, or SELF-ARCHIVE must include **`[gated-merge]`** in the message (the merge scriptâ€™s `--push` does this). **GitHub Actions** runs the same rule on pull requests (`governance.yml` job `gated-record-pr`). Manual emergency edits: `ALLOW_GATED_RECORD_EDIT=1` locally; optional repo secret of the same name bypasses the CI check. See AGENTS.md File Update Protocol.

Recommended rhythm: do this at least weekly (e.g. [OPERATOR-WEEKLY-REVIEW](operator-weekly-review.md) step 2) so the Record and SELF-ARCHIVE stay in sync with conversations.

## Getting Telegram chat content into Cursor

The bot (and other writers) append chat to **`session-transcript.md`** per channel and stage profile candidates to **`recursion-gate.md`** â€” **one gate for all channels** (`channel_key` on each block). Paths are relative to the **repo root of the process running the bot**. So whether that content appears in Cursor depends on where the bot runs.

**Option A â€” Bot runs on the same machine as Cursor, from this repo**

- Run the Telegram bot from this repo (e.g. `python -m bot.bot` or your start command from the operator `grace-mar` instance checkout).
- Set `GRACE_MAR_USER_ID=grace-mar` (or leave default).
- Then **`session-transcript.md`** and **recursion-gate.md** are inside this workspace; just open them in Cursor. New exchanges appear as the bot runs.

**Option B â€” Bot runs elsewhere (e.g. Render, another server)**

- The bot writes to that environmentâ€™s clone of the repo. To get that content into Cursor:
  1. **Pull from GitHub** â€” If the server (or a job on it) commits and pushes `session-transcript.md` and `recursion-gate.md` to the same repo you use in Cursor, run `git pull` in Cursor to get the latest.
  2. **Sync script** â€” If you have SSH or an API to the server, add a small script that copies those two files from the server into this repo (e.g. `scp server:grace-mar/session-transcript.md `), then run it when you want to refresh.
  3. **Manual paste** â€” Copy the chat from your log viewer or Telegram export and paste into a file in this repo (e.g. create `LOG-2026-02-25.md` or append to a notes file). Use that for operator context; it wonâ€™t update SESSION-TRANSCRIPT on the server.

**Bot on Render (24/7)** â€” Use the operator fetch so Cursor gets the live chat and pipeline:

1. In **Render** â†’ your service â†’ Environment: add **`OPERATOR_FETCH_SECRET`** (e.g. a long random string). Redeploy.
2. In **Cursor** (repo root), run:
   ```bash
   export OPERATOR_FETCH_SECRET=the-same-secret
   export GRACE_MAR_RENDER_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com
   python3 scripts/fetch_operator_files.py
   ```
   This writes `session-transcript.md` and `recursion-gate.md`. Run whenever you want to refresh.

**Option C â€” One-off: save a log snippet in the repo**

- To keep a specific conversation (e.g. the Feb 25 history Q&A) in the repo for reference: create a file like **`notes/2026-02-25-telegram-log.md`** and paste the conversation and any analyst line (e.g. â€œANALYST: signal detected - staged candidateâ€) into it. That way itâ€™s in Cursor and in version control without touching the botâ€™s live files.

**Summary**

| Bot runs in | What to do so Cursor has the chat |
|-------------|------------------------------------|
| This repo (same machine) | Run bot from this repo; open `session-transcript.md`. |
| **Render (24/7)** | Set `OPERATOR_FETCH_SECRET` on Render; run `python3 scripts/fetch_operator_files.py` from Cursor with `GRACE_MAR_RENDER_URL` and the same secret. Opens `session-transcript.md` and `recursion-gate.md` after fetch. |
| Other remote | Use fetch script if the host exposes the same operator endpoints; or sync the two files by another means; or paste into a notes file. |

## Before the Session

1. Read [letter-to-user.md](letter-to-user.md) (or [letter-to-student.md](letter-to-student.md) for a school-aged variant) if you want to frame it for the companion
2. Ensure you can type responses in real time (or plan for transcription)
3. Confirm consent (verbal is fine; we log it in SESSION-LOG)
