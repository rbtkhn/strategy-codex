# Harness event replay

**North star (full causal debugger):** See [harness-replay-spec.md](harness-replay-spec.md) — three modes (answer / proposal / merge), future event envelope, UI shape, and pairing with the [boundary review queue](boundary-review-queue.md).

**Purpose (this CLI):** Reconstruct **audit-lane** context for a **staged proposal** (candidate) or **bundle** export—**not** a full neural “why did the model say X” trace unless that was logged elsewhere.

**Implementation:** `scripts/replay_harness_event.py` calls `grace_mar.replay.build_report`. Loaders read `*.jsonl` first and fall back to `runtime-bundle/audit/` when a root file is missing or empty ([architecture.md](architecture.md) — profile root vs bundle).

Grace-Mar separates **record**, **runtime**, **audit**, and **policy** ([harness-inventory.md](harness-inventory.md)). Replay pulls from the **audit** lane:

| Source | What it explains |
|--------|------------------|
| `pipeline-events.jsonl` | staged / applied / rejected and extras |
| `harness-events.jsonl` | merge_applied, exports, bundle ids |
| `merge-receipts.jsonl` | merge batch, approver, checksum snapshot |
| `recursion-gate.md` | Current **or** **Processed** candidate YAML (if still in file) |
| `self-archive.md` (EVIDENCE) | ACT line if `--evidence` given |

New pipeline/harness lines include **`event_id`**, **`fork_id`**, **`envelope_version`**, and often **`replay_mode`** (`proposal` / `merge` / `gate`, …). **`parent_event_id`** links **`applied`** / gate decisions to the earlier **`staged`** row when both have ids; merge harness lines may list **`applied_pipeline_event_ids`**. Older lines omit these; the replay report adds an **Audit envelope** section when `event_id` is present.

**Limitations**

- **Voice answers:** Full SYSTEM prompt + retrieval trace per message is **not** stored in harness-events by default. Use **session-transcript** tail (`--transcript-snippet`) only as a **hint**—it may be redacted or huge.
- **Processed candidates** removed from `recursion-gate.md` leave only **pipeline + harness + merge-receipts**; git history may still have the block.
- **Trust:** Replay shows **what was recorded**, not cryptographic proof of model internals.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/replay_harness_event.py -u grace-mar --candidate CANDIDATE-0089
python scripts/replay_harness_event.py -u grace-mar --bundle-id 5229e838372b
python scripts/replay_harness_event.py -u grace-mar --event-id evt_20260320_120000_a1b2c3d4
python scripts/replay_harness_event.py -u grace-mar --candidate CANDIDATE-0085 --evidence ACT-0024 --transcript-snippet
```

Output is **markdown** to stdout; redirect to a file for tickets.
