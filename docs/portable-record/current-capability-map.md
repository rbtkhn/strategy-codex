# Portability â€” current-state capability map

What Grace-Mar already solves and what must not be duplicated. All documented export classes are operational.

---

## Already solved

These capabilities are live in the grace-mar instance.

| Capability | Implementation | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Governed canonical Record** | Four first-class surfaces: SELF, SELF-LIBRARY, SKILLS, EVIDENCE. Companion approval required for all durable changes. | Live |
| **Runtime vs Record split** | Durable Record governed by the pipeline; runtime artifacts (skill cards, lane compression, memory briefs, warmup output) are derived and rebuildable. | Live â€” [runtime-vs-record.md](../runtime-vs-record.md) |
| **Prepared selective retrieval** | Progressive-disclosure index, budgeted context builds, memory briefs. Runtime-only; not Record. | Live â€” [prepared-context/](../../prepared-context/), [progressive-disclosure.md](../prepared-context/progressive-disclosure.md) |
| **PRP export** | Single pasteable prompt encoding the Record for any LLM. URL bootstrap supported. | Live â€” [`scripts/export_prp.py`](../../scripts/export_prp.py), [portable-record-prompt.md](../portable-record-prompt.md) |
| **Runtime bundle export** | Structured export with `record/`, `policy/`, `runtime/`, `audit/` directories. | Live â€” [`scripts/export_runtime_bundle.py`](../../scripts/export_runtime_bundle.py) |
| **JSON fork export** | Machine-readable Record snapshot. Optional JSON-LD output. | Live â€” [`scripts/export_fork.py`](../../scripts/export_fork.py), [EXPORT-CLI.md](../EXPORT-CLI.md) |
| **Unified export CLI** | Single dispatcher across all export modules. | Live â€” [`scripts/export.py`](../../scripts/export.py), [EXPORT-CLI.md](../EXPORT-CLI.md) |
| **Approval Inbox / recursion-gate** | Staging queue with YAML candidates, companion approval, merge script. | Live â€” [`recursion-gate.md`](../../recursion-gate.md), [`scripts/process_approved_candidates.py`](../../scripts/process_approved_candidates.py) |
| **Integrity validation** | 12-check validator covering boundary, convenience-path, and export freshness. | Live â€” [`scripts/validate-integrity.py`](../../scripts/validate-integrity.py) |
| **Export contract** | Six export classes (full governed, task-limited, tool bootstrap, demonstrated capability, emulation-ready, internal-only) over existing exporters. | Live â€” [export-contract.md](export-contract.md) |
| **External-AI extraction prompt pack** | Structured prompt + import script for extracting portable working-identity from other AI systems into governed candidate objects. | Live â€” [extraction-prompt-pack.md](extraction-prompt-pack.md), [`scripts/import_working_identity_candidates.py`](../../scripts/import_working_identity_candidates.py) |
| **Working-identity candidate schema** | Normalized JSON Schema for imported context that enters gate review before promotion to Record. | Live â€” [`schema-registry/working-identity-candidate.v1.json`](../../schema-registry/working-identity-candidate.v1.json), [working-identity-candidates.md](working-identity-candidates.md) |
| **Artifact-rationale format** | Structured format for demonstrated capability with provenance (why it was built, not just that it exists). | Live â€” [artifact-rationale.md](artifact-rationale.md), [`schema-registry/artifact-rationale.v1.json`](../../schema-registry/artifact-rationale.v1.json) |
| **Export-class CLI wiring** | `export.py --export-class` flag routes `tool_bootstrap`, `full`, `task_limited`, `capability`, and `emulation` to existing child exporters. `internal` rejects clearly. | Live â€” [`scripts/export.py`](../../scripts/export.py), [export-contract.md](export-contract.md) |
| **Thin MCP adapter** | Read-only MCP server over governed export classes for tool-using agents. Wraps existing export machinery; stdio transport; no write-back. | Live â€” [`integrations/mcp_adapter.py`](../../integrations/mcp_adapter.py), [mcp-adapter.md](../integrations/mcp-adapter.md) |
| **Demonstrated-capability export** | Dedicated exporter filtering SKILLS + EVIDENCE into a portfolio view with artifact-rationale companions. Five seed rationales authored. | Live â€” [`scripts/export_capability.py`](../../scripts/export_capability.py), [`artifacts/rationales/`](../../artifacts/rationales/) |
| **Emulation-ready export** | Thin composition over PRP, fork export, runtime bundle, and existing proposal/membrane return paths. | Live â€” [`scripts/export_emulation_bundle.py`](../../scripts/export_emulation_bundle.py), [export-contract.md](export-contract.md) |

## Anti-duplication rule

Do not build a second memory system, a second export pipeline, or a second prepared-context layer. Extend the existing architecture:

- New export formats extend [`scripts/export.py`](../../scripts/export.py)
- New retrieval paths extend the prepared-context pipeline
- New candidate types use `recursion-gate.md` staging and `process_approved_candidates.py`
- New schemas go in `schema-registry/`
