# Export contract

Grace-Mar's outward portability layer: a coherent set of governed export classes over existing approved surfaces and existing exporters.

---

## Principle

Grace-Mar exports are **governed views** over companion-approved content — not raw memory dumps, not unreviewed runtime residue, not unfiltered candidate queues. Every export draws from the four canonical Record surfaces (SELF, SELF-LIBRARY, SKILLS, EVIDENCE) after content has passed through the gated pipeline.

Runtime-only material (warmup, memory briefs, skill cards, lane compression) may appear in runtime-aware export modes but is clearly marked as derived and non-canonical.

---

## Export classes

| Class | Purpose | Typical use |
|---|---|---|
| **Full governed profile** | Broad view across all approved surfaces, filtered by sensitivity | Primary runtime sideload, full fork handoff |
| **Task-limited profile** | Filtered slices from surfaces relevant to a specific task or role | Coach handoff, domain-specific onboarding |
| **Tool bootstrap profile** | Compact prompt encoding the Record for bootstrapping a new tool session | Pasting into a new LLM, agent cold start |
| **Demonstrated capability profile** | SKILLS + EVIDENCE focused — what this person can do and has done | Portfolio export, capability audit |
| **Emulation-ready profile** | Thin composition over existing governed exports plus policy/review return references | Loading a foreign runtime or harness without creating a new portability ontology |
| **Internal-only** | Content approved into the Record but marked non-portable | Never exported; stays in the governed Record only |

---

## Allowed contents by class

| Surface | Full governed | Task-limited | Tool bootstrap | Demonstrated capability | Internal-only |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SELF** | Yes (sensitivity-filtered) | Relevant slices | Partial (core identity) | Minimal (context only) | May include non-portable entries |
| **SELF-LIBRARY** | Yes (sensitivity-filtered) | Relevant domains | Partial (key domains) | Minimal | May include non-portable entries |
| **SKILLS** | Yes | Relevant workflows | Selected skills | Yes — primary surface | May include non-portable entries |
| **EVIDENCE** | Yes (sensitivity-filtered) | Relevant artifacts | No (too large) | Yes — primary surface | May include non-portable entries |
| **Runtime** | Yes (marked derived) | No | No | No | N/A |

Sensitivity filtering: entries with `sensitivity_class: non_portable` or `portability_class: non_exportable` are excluded from all external-facing classes. `review_required` entries are included only after companion review clears them.

## Current export entry points

Each export class maps to existing scripts. Five classes are operational via `--export-class`; one is not exported by definition. No second export system is needed.

| Class | Status | Script | `--export-class` | Subcommand equivalent |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tool bootstrap profile** | Operational | [`export_prp.py`](../../scripts/export_prp.py) | `export.py --export-class tool_bootstrap` | `export.py prp` |
| **Full governed profile** | Operational | [`export_runtime_bundle.py`](../../scripts/export_runtime_bundle.py) | `export.py --export-class full` | `export.py bundle -- --mode portable_bundle_only` |
| **Full governed profile (with runtime)** | Operational | [`export_runtime_bundle.py`](../../scripts/export_runtime_bundle.py) | — | `export.py bundle -- --mode adjunct_runtime` |
| **Task-limited profile** | Operational | [`export_fork.py`](../../scripts/export_fork.py) | `export.py --export-class task_limited` | `export.py fork -- --format coach-handoff` |
| **Demonstrated capability profile** | Operational | [`export_capability.py`](../../scripts/export_capability.py) | `export.py --export-class capability` | — |
| **Emulation-ready profile** | Operational | [`export_emulation_bundle.py`](../../scripts/export_emulation_bundle.py) | `export.py --export-class emulation` | `export.py emulation -- --mode portable_bundle_only` |
| **Internal-only** | Not exported | Content stays in governed Record | Rejects with explanation | — |

Additional exporters: `export_user_identity.py` (identity sections), `export_manifest.py` (policy manifest), `export_view.py` (audience views: `school`, `public`).

## Anti-duplication rule

This contract governs the existing export layer. It does not create a second export system:

- Export classes are **policy labels** over the existing `export.py` subcommands and their child scripts
- Filtering logic lives in the child scripts, not in a separate portability stack
- New export formats extend [`scripts/export.py`](../../scripts/export.py) as subcommands
- Emulation packaging may compose existing exporters, but it must still return through existing review or membrane surfaces
- New schemas go in `schemas/registry/`

---

## CLI integration

The `--export-class` flag on `export.py` routes to the correct child script with appropriate arguments:

```
python scripts/export.py --export-class tool_bootstrap -- -o prompt.txt
python scripts/export.py --export-class full -- -o /tmp/bundle
python scripts/export.py -u grace-mar --export-class task_limited -- -o handoff.json
python scripts/export.py --export-class capability -- -o capability.json
python scripts/export.py --export-class emulation -- -o /tmp/emulation-bundle
```

Five classes are operational: `tool_bootstrap`, `full`, `task_limited`, `capability`, `emulation`. The only non-exportable class (`internal`) exits with code 2 and an explanation. Existing subcommand invocations (`export.py fork`, `export.py prp`, etc.) continue to work unchanged.

---

## MCP adapter

The same export classes are available programmatically via a read-only MCP server at [`platform/integrations/mcp_adapter.py`](../../platform/integrations/mcp_adapter.py). It wraps the existing export machinery over stdio transport — no second export stack, no write-back. Five operational classes (`tool_bootstrap`, `full`, `task_limited`, `capability`, `emulation`) are retrievable; `internal` rejects with explanation. See [mcp-adapter.md](../platform/integrations/mcp-adapter.md) for configuration and response shapes.
