# Review to merge

Companion-Self template · From decision to governed state update

---

## Purpose

Control the transition from a **reviewed** proposal to an update of **governed state** (Record and related durable surfaces).

---

## Requirements

- **Explicit decision** — decision record and/or proposal `status` aligned with instance rules.
- **Preserved prior state or diff** — history remains inspectable ([`schemas/registry/identity-diff.v1.json`](../../schemas/registry/identity-diff.v1.json) when used; `scripts/generate-identity-diff.py` for Markdown views).
- **Durable trace** — why the change happened (queue summary, notes, event log).
- **Merge path limited to authorized surfaces** — no cross-surface silent edits outside policy.

---

## Rule

**Acceptance is not silent overwrite.** A merge should preserve enough trace to explain what changed and why. Instance merge scripts and gate doctrine remain authoritative for *how* merge runs.
