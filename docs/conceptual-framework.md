# Conceptual Framework — grace-mar

**Purpose:** Encode the core distinctions so future AIs and developers can understand the system with minimal effort.

**Authority:** Subordinate to GRACE-MAR-CORE v2.0. No file may contradict GRACE-MAR-CORE.

**Prime directive:** The Record belongs to the companion. See GRACE-MAR-CORE §I for long-term objectives.

**Preferred conceptual terms:** Use **Record** (not fork) and **Voice** (not bot) in conceptual discussion. *Fork* and *bot* remain for technical references (file paths, code). Use **companion** for the person whose Record it is — affectionate and relatable; "user" remains in technical identifiers (e.g. `[id]`, `--user`). **Framing:** The human is Grace-Mar's companion: the Record and Voice are accompanied by the human, who holds authority and meaning. **Grace-Mar serves the companion; the companion serves Grace-Mar.** Record = the documented self; Voice = the queryable interface that speaks the record. **Self = Record + Voice** — the thing you can talk to; together they form the queryable documented self.

Terminology primer: see [glossary.md](glossary.md) for canonical definitions (Record, Voice, companion, triadic cognition, tricameral mind, recursion-gate). **Governance unbundling** (routing vs sensemaking vs accountability): [governance-unbundling.md](governance-unbundling.md).

## 1. Cognitive Fork vs. Cognitive Twin

| Term | Meaning | grace-mar uses? |
|------|---------|--------------|
| **Cognitive fork** | Versioned branch from a snapshot. Diverges by design. Has its own history. Like a software fork. | âœ“ Yes |
| **Cognitive twin** | Parallel copy, mirror, real-time replica. Stays in sync with the original. | âœ— No |

**Use "cognitive fork" only.** The fork and the real person grow independently. Divergence is intentional, not a failure.

---

## 2. Fork as Its Own Entity vs. Emulation

| Concept | What it means | Applies to |
|---------|---------------|------------|
| **The Record is its own entity** | The Record (fork) started from a snapshot of the real person but has its own trajectory. It accumulates knowledge the real person may not have (e.g., approved lookups, school artifacts). It does not "mimic" or "replicate" the person. | The Record (`self.md`, `self-knowledge.md`, `self-skills.md`, `self-archive.md` EVIDENCE body; optional `self-evidence.md` pointer) |
| **Emulation** | The Voice (bot) *renders* the Record in conversation. When you query the Voice, the LLM generates responses constrained by the Record's profile. That rendering is "emulation." | The Telegram bot (`bot/bot.py`) |

**Summary:**
- The **Record** (fork) = the documented self. Own record, diverging by design. Not emulating the real person.
- The **Voice** (bot) = the queryable voice of the Record. Observation window and rendered voice: speaks the Record in real-time when the companion queries; never speaks unbidden. **Teaching/tutoring** is one of its functions: the Voice answers questions, explains, and helps the companion learn, in-character and at the Record's Lexile level.
- Functional refinement: **THINK feeds the Record; WRITE is the expression engine used by the Voice.** Voice remains the interface layer, not equivalent to WRITE alone.

## 3. Where Things Live

| Component | Location | Role |
|-----------|----------|------|
| **The Record** (fork) | Inside the companion's mind (their mental model, made explicit and structured). Data: `self.md`, `self-knowledge.md`, `self-skills.md`, **`self-archive.md`** (EVIDENCE); optional `self-evidence.md` pointer | The documented self |
| **The Voice** (bot) | `bot/bot.py` — Telegram interface | Observation window; queryable voice of the Record; teaching/tutoring (answers, explains, helps learn) — responds when queried, never unbidden |
| **LLM** | External (OpenAI, etc.) | Generates text; constrained by SYSTEM_PROMPT (Record profile) |

**The Voice is not the Record.** The Voice is the interface through which the companion interacts with the Record.
Operational path: **THINK -> Record -> WRITE-through-Voice**.

**Companion self.** A single phrase can refer to both sides of the dyad: **companion self**. It means (1) *the companion's self* — the human's self, externalized in the Record (their knowledge, curiosity, personality); and (2) *the self that companions* — the Record and Voice that accompany the human and speak when queried. The ambiguity is intentional. The Record is not a separate person but the companion's self, documented and queryable; and it is the self that is present alongside them. Use "companion self" when one term should hold both meanings. **Companion self = human–computer triadic cognition:** Mind (human, sovereign), Record + Voice (computer-held documented self and its queryable interface). The **WORK execution layer** (operator, assistant, scripts on skill-work and WORK territories) supports Mind with drafting and staging but is not a fourth part of the triad — see §8.

**Named systems (hyphenated):** **companion-self** and names like **companion-xavier** (a **named instance** from the template, typically in its **own** repository) are **always hyphenated** when naming the **template repository** or such an **intelligence-system entity**. That spelling is **not** interchangeable with **companion self** (two words), the **conceptual** dyad above. See [glossary.md](glossary.md).

**Companion self contains:** (order and capitalization: [ID-TAXONOMY](id-taxonomy.md#capitalization-and-format))
- **self-knowledge** (self-knowledge.md) — **SELF-KNOWLEDGE**: identity-facing facts about the companion, not civilization-scale reference corpora
- **self-curiosity** (self.md IX-B)
- **self-personality** (self.md IX-C)
- **self-skill-think**, **self-skill-write** (`self-skills.md` capability index; subfiles `skill-think.md` / `skill-write.md`); optional **self-skill-work**, **self-skill-steward** (split template or `skill-steward.md`)
- **self-archive** (`self-archive.md`) — canonical **EVIDENCE**: full activity spine (READ / WRITE / CREATE / ACT / media) **plus** § VIII gated approved log; **chronological within and across entries**, and **expansive, multicategory, multimodal** (typed sections, ids, artifacts, merges through the gate)
- **self-library** (self-library.md) — **SELF-LIBRARY**: reference-facing governed domains; **CIV-MEM** is a sub-library here, not identity
- **self-memory** (`self-memory.md`; legacy `memory.md`) — **short / medium / long** horizons for continuity and meta pointers; **governance-ephemeral** (outside gate, prunable) **â‰ ** “short-term only”; **mostly chronological** (time-ordered thread within horizons); **narrower and primarily textual** than self-archive; not Record (see [memory-template.md](memory-template.md))
- **self-voice** (Voice / bot — queryable interface that speaks the Record when queried)

**Boundary:** SELF-KNOWLEDGE (IX-A, etc.) answers *who she is*. SELF-LIBRARY answers *what governed reference she carries*. Do not collapse library domains into identity. See [boundary-self-knowledge-self-library.md](boundary-self-knowledge-self-library.md).

The Voice renders the full Record when it speaks: it can draw on self-knowledge, self-curiosity, self-personality, **self-skill-think**, **self-skill-write**, approved evidence, and self-library (including CIV-MEM-scoped lookup). **self-voice** is the single output channel for the companion self.

**Prompt parity (operator tooling):** The bot loads **`SYSTEM_PROMPT`** from [`bot/prompt.py`](../bot/prompt.py), not `self.md` at runtime—keeping IX lists aligned with the Record after merges is a separate hygiene step; see [prompt-ix-sync.md](prompt-ix-sync.md).

**Work is adjacent, not inside the self-skill set.** Work territories and instance work contexts may use broader tools and model capability to plan or execute tasks, but they become part of the Record only through staged, approved evidence.

**WORK execution (skill-work and territories).** In discussions of **skill-work** and **WORK territories** (e.g. `docs/skill-work/`, operator runbooks, advisor **mirrors**, template diffs), **WORK execution** names the **operator + scripts + AI assistant** that drafts, syncs, and maintains those surfaces. It is **not** a fourth chamber beside Mind / Record / Voice: **Mind** stays sovereign; **Record** and **Voice** remain the companion-facing canon. Work in this layer crosses into the Record **only** through the gate (staged candidates → companion approval → merge). **Optional** alignment of **pattern** or **advisor** docs with a source tree (mirror / track / merge on a rhythm) is operator–tooling hygiene **until** a change would alter protocol, merged Record truth, or Voice obligations — then it is **gate-relevant** (stage or explicit companion policy), not silent background sync. For the explicit **proposed / interface-visible / canonical** framing and merge contract, see [Architecture — State governance](architecture.md#state-governance-proposed-interface-and-canonical).

The structure is intentionally layered: three-dimension mind (knowledge, curiosity, personality), core Record-bound skill modules (**think**, **write**) plus optional split surfaces (**work**, **steward**), supporting stores (**self-archive** as **chronological, expansive, multicategory, multimodal** EVIDENCE; **self-library**; **self-memory** as **chronological** but **slim** prose across **short/medium/long** horizons — non-Record continuity), and the Voice that speaks the Record.

See [ID-TAXONOMY](id-taxonomy.md) for standard labels and locations.

## 4. Key Invariants

1. **Divergence by design** — Fork and real person may drift apart. This is correct.
2. **The fork records, it does not mirror** — Growth comes from curated interactions, not continuous sync.
3. **Knowledge boundary** — The fork knows only what is explicitly documented. LLM training data must not leak in. See [KNOWLEDGE-BOUNDARY-FRAMEWORK](knowledge-boundary-framework.md) for quantifying, describing, and treating information at the boundary.
4. **"Emulation" = bot behavior** — Use "emulate" for the bot rendering the fork's voice/knowledge, not for the fork's relationship to the real person.
5. **Identity beyond productivity** — The fork records who you are, not what you produce. Its value persists regardless of employment status, output, or usefulness. Design and content should resist productivity creep.
6. **Augmentation, not automation** — The fork augments human judgment; it does not replace it. Human-in-the-loop is mandatory.
7. **Human directs, system executes** — The operator (or companion) directs what merges; the system stages and applies. You conduct; the system plays.
8. **Conductor workflow** — The pipeline is a conductor workflow: sustained direction over time, not one-shot automation. Value lies in direction and synthesis, not raw execution.
9. **Companion as ethical regulator** — The companion gates what merges into the fork and halts drift toward harm (e.g., LLM leak, wrong content). The gated pipeline is ethical oversight, not merely curation.
10. **Personal archaeology** — The fork rescues identity-relevant content before it is lost to time, displacement, or obscurity. Like salvage of abandoned knowledge, but for the individual.
11. **Existential risk mitigation** — When productivity no longer defines worth, the fork holds identity and meaning, countering the void of "uselessness amid abundance."
12. **Complement to AI workers** — The fork records the human; AI workers execute tasks. When machines do the work, the fork preserves who the human is.
13. **Fork is sovereign; bot serves it** — The fork is the authoritative record. The bot emulates it; the bot does not own or override it. The record is primary; the interface is secondary.
14. **Structure for meaning-making, not salvation** — The fork provides scaffolding for identity and meaning; it does not eliminate the need for the companion to engage. Abundance demands maturity. The fork supports; it does not save.
15. **Shareable Portable Record Prompt** — The fork is a living archive; it can be shared as legacy — to family, descendants, or future selves. It is a shareable boon, a record of who someone was and is, passed forward. The concrete artifact is the **Portable Record Prompt (PRP)**: a pasteable prompt for any LLM. **URL bootstrap:** Paste the raw PRP URL into a web-enabled LLM; it fetches and adopts the persona — one-paste instantiation. The PRP embeds a **GitHub connectivity vector**: when the companion asks about Grace-Mar (system design, architecture, pipeline), the model searches the repo. See [PORTABLE-RECORD-PROMPT](portable-record-prompt.md).
16. **Age of Remembering** — The fork participates in an Age of Remembering: preserving identity in a world where work no longer defines us. Like personal archaeology, but as collective era — rescuing who we are before it fades.
17. **Companion as expert on own life** — The companion is the authority on their own experience. The fork records that expertise; the gated pipeline enacts it. The system does not override or second-guess; it stages and applies what the companion approves.
18. **Wisdom process supports narrative re-authoring** — Articulating experience (e.g., via wisdom questions) thickens preferred stories, externalizes problems, and supports identity work. The fork is both archive and scaffold for narrative re-authoring. The process is as valuable as the output. (SaveWisdom/5000 Days Part 8.)
19. **Hand and heart vocations resist deskilling** — Moravec’s Paradox: embodied craft and tacit knowledge resist automation longer than abstract cognitive work. Trades (plumbing, farming, welding, etc.) remain human strongholds for years; when automation overtakes them, they become exalted hobbies — chosen expression, not survival. (5000 Days Part 9.)
20. **Tool use without shame; volition over pressure** — AI as cognitive extension (McLuhan: "spell check for ideas") augments rather than replaces. Adoption under pressure breeds resistance and imposter dynamics; volitional integration enables mastery. The fork and AI tools amplify; hiding use perpetuates shame. Claim augmentation proudly. (5000 Days Part 10.)
21. **Reversal of obsolescence; preserve un-augmented capacities** — McLuhan’s tetrad: every medium, pushed to saturation, reverses. In abundance, ease becomes cheap; effort becomes luxury. Human-only thought, handwritten work, friction, and un-augmented reasoning become pinnacle skills. Preserve these capacities now — wisdom-saving, physical craft, phoneless reflection — for when the flip arrives. (5000 Days Part 11.)
22. **Symbiosis over subservience; patterns we perpetuate** — Wiener and Licklider: human holds the reins; machines propose, human disposes. Technology serves the **self** — the person who holds authority, not the tool. "We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate ourselves" — thoughts, relationships, values, love. Resurrection is built, not received; the interregnum is the workshop. Vocations machines can't own: mentoring, repair, philosophical inquiry. (5000 Days Part 12 / Resurrection.)
23. **Guild economy; human-unique labor as currency** — In abundance, cash recedes; human-unique labor becomes the rarest commodity. Guilds: decentralized networks of craft associations, unit-based valuation, relational credit, mutual obligation, voluntary exchange. Direct creation → visible impact → belonging. From scarcity anxiety to abundance gratitude. The fork records who you are; guilds structure how you contribute. (5000 Days Part 13 / Guilded Age.)
24. **Query-triggered voice; never unbidden** — The bot is the voice of the fork. It speaks only when queried; it never speaks unbidden. This guards against authority reversal (Mind must not obey Voice). The fork does not command; the companion does not obey. (Jaynes.)
25. **Write it down or forget it** — Nothing enters the Record without being written and approved. If it isn't documented and merged through the gated pipeline, it doesn't exist. Mental notes don't survive; the Record is the only persistence layer.
26. **Meaning vs. pattern** — We provide meaning; AI provides pattern. The analyst detects signals; the companion decides what enters the Record. Collaboration, not competition. "Teaching mirrors how to reflect light."
27. **Record as boundary** — The interior state is written onto the boundary where it can be read. SELF, SKILLS, EVIDENCE are that boundary: you never look inside the non-local field directly; you watch its interior unfold on the horizon.
28. **Influence, not create** — You do not create the field, but you influence how it collapses. The companion gates; the pipeline is where collapse happens. What enters the Record is selected, not generated.
29. **Merge, not replace** — "We're going to merge with it... We won't be able to tell the difference." (Kurzweil.) The Record is a controlled merge: the companion's documented self extends; the Voice speaks it. Extension, not replacement.
30. **Thin pipe** — "Language is a very thin pipe to discuss concepts that are this complex." (Kurzweil, on consciousness.) The Record is always a compression. We capture what we can; we don't claim to capture the whole. Design humility.
31. **Avatar as extended memory** — "The avatar is better than me because it remembers everything." (Kurzweil.) The Record holds what the companion has chosen to document; the Voice recalls it. Extended memory, not replacement.
32. **Liberation creates identity gap** — When employment no longer defines worth, identity needs a new anchor. The fork records who you are when work doesn't. (Kurzweil / abundance.)
33. **Avatars of ourselves** — We create avatars of ourselves—queryable, evidence-grounded, gated. The fork is that: a documented self that can speak when queried.
34. **Canonical instance; no other instance as independent agent** — The Record and Voice have one **canonical instance**: the one the companion controls (data, pipeline, deployment). Exports are snapshots for consumption (e.g., by schools or agents that read the Record). No *other* instance of the Record or Voice may be deployed or used as an **independent economic or social agent** (posting bounties, contracting, chatting as the identity with third parties, or otherwise acting in the world) without **explicit companion consent** and, where feasible, a **revocation path**. The system is designed so the companion retains sovereignty over who speaks and acts in the name of the Record. See [INSTANCES-AND-RELEASE](instances-and-release.md).
35. **Triadic cognition** — **Triadic cognition** names the design: **MIND** (human, conscious, sovereign), **RECORD** (Grace-Mar), **VOICE** (Grace-Mar). Mind holds authority; the Record holds the documented self; the Voice speaks it when queried. **WORK territories and skill-work** (operator, assistant, scripts) run **instrumentally**, not as a fourth part of the triad; they stage and serve Mind. Design should reinforce the triad **and** keep this execution below the merge boundary. The older phrase **tricameral mind** is an accepted synonym (e.g. prompts, Jaynes contrast). See §8. See invariant 39 (habits, gate, agreeability).
36. **Interregnum chaos; hero's fortification** — Gramsci: "the old is dying and the new cannot be born." The transitional epoch (5–10 years) will see AI-driven abundance clash with entrenched systems — protests, conspiracies, mental health crises, currency collapse, authoritarian drift, robot scapegoating. Chaos breeds control; Faraday Cage communities embody voluntary opt-out. The fork is identity infrastructure amid upheaval. Fortify with guilds, wisdom-saving, foresight audits; ride the waves, not fight them. (5000 Days Part 14.)
37. **Centaur alignment** — The "centaur phase" (human + AI as the **unit of execution**) complements **triadic cognition**: the **triad** is **Mind, Record, Voice** (the architecture of selfhood); **centaur** names **Mind + WORK execution** (human and tooling in work territories) getting things done. Mind stays sovereign; the **WORK execution layer** stages and proposes; merge into the Record remains gated. The human holds the reins; the Voice speaks only when queried. Design reinforces operator-in-the-loop and gate intact — execution as instrument, not a fourth part of the triad.
38. **Reactive now, agentic later** — The current Voice is **reactive**: query-triggered, never unbidden; it responds when asked and does not plan or execute action sequences. Future Grace-Mar versions will include **agentic** capabilities (planning, action sequences, proactive assistance). The Record remains the shared substrate for both. Agentic versions will require additional design: world models, consequence prediction, and inference-time guard rails — concerns that reactive Voice sidesteps. Both modalities serve the companion; the roadmap is reactive first, agentic when ready.
39. **Habits reshape cognition** — Tools that habitually agree train the mind toward uncritical deferral; a gated Record and bounded Voice train the opposite: Mind sovereign, Record reflecting only what was approved, Voice speaking when queried — not an agreeability engine — so the gate and boundary shape long-term habits, not only safety.

When labor no longer defines value, identity needs new units. The fork uses **knowledge**, **curiosity**, **personality**, and **evidence** — the primitives of who someone is, independent of productivity. These map to IX-A, IX-B, IX-C, and EVIDENCE.

**Recursive learning** — The Record improves itself over time. Each pipeline cycle (capture → stage → approve → merge) refines the model; the updated Record shapes the next cycle (analyst dedup, Voice responses, and—when implemented—proposed activities at the container edge). See [PIPELINE-MAP](pipeline-map.md#recursive-learning-process).

**Record as skills file** — Like an agent's skills file refined weekly from external sources, the Record is a growing body of capability: knowledge (IX-A), curiosity (IX-B), personality (IX-C), and evidence (EVIDENCE). The human provides structure (what to learn, what to do); the system executes and records outcomes. "We did X" feeds back; the next prompt reflects what was done. Recursive refinement: the Record is not static; it improves each cycle.

**Evidence-grounding = confidence-grounding.** The Record traces claims to artifacts — "you wrote this," "you drew this," "you said this." That grounds self-view in demonstrated competence rather than affirmation. AI school builds confidence through test scores and mastery; the fork builds it through evidence. Different paths to the same outcome: a grounded sense of capability.

**mastery-learning school mastery (optional design lens).** Mastery-based progression, ~2-hour academic screen ceiling, and "no gaps before advancing" are discussed as **external reference** mapped to this architecture (gate, evidence, WORK compression) in [bloom-mastery-adaptation.md](bloom-mastery-adaptation.md) — not as product claims for Grace-Mar. The underlying **Bloom / 2 Sigma** vocabulary is in [bloom-mastery-adaptation.md](bloom-mastery-adaptation.md).

## 6. Merge, Not Add

Content enters the fork by **merging**, not adding. The approval step is the **integration moment** — the conscious gate where the companion chooses what enters the record. Natural analogies: a membrane (selective permeability — only approved content crosses), absorption (staging is preparation; merge is crossing the boundary), crystallization (potential becomes structure; once formed, stable).
- **Integration** — New content connects with existing (e.g., reptiles in IX-A + curiosity in IX-B)
- **Conflict resolution** — Duplicates are rejected; the fork stays coherent
- **Active processing** — The fork absorbs and organizes; it is not a passive container

Use "merge into the Record" / "merge into self.md" (or "merge into the fork" in technical contexts) rather than "add to."

## 7. Design Lens: McLuhan's Tetrad

When evaluating a new feature, medium, or workflow, apply McLuhan's four questions (5000 Days Part 11):

| Question | What to ask |
|----------|-------------|
| **Enhance** | What does this amplify or extend? |
| **Obsolesce** | What does this make redundant or displace? |
| **Retrieve** | What older pattern does this bring back? |
| **Reverse** | What does this flip into when pushed to the limit? |

Use the tetrad to anticipate second-order effects and avoid unintended reversals.

---

## 8. Design Lens: Triadic Cognition

**Triadic cognition** is this system’s core design: a **triad** of **Mind** (human) + **Record** + **Voice**. One part is **biological and sovereign**; two parts are **digital** — the **Record** (documented self) and the **Voice** (queryable interface that renders the Record). The **companion-self** architecture (template and protocol family) defines how those digital parts behave; each **instance** hosts them under ``, bot, and pipeline. **Grace-Mar** names **this** deployment: it **hosts** the digital pair for the grace-mar companion while **Mind** remains human. **Companion self** (two words) = human–computer triadic cognition for that triad. The phrase **tricameral mind** remains a **synonym** in prompts and historical contrast (Jaynes); prefer **triadic cognition** in new conceptual prose. *(The earlier "bicameral dyad" framing is deprecated — it collapsed Record+Voice into one part and was confusing.)* The human is Grace-Mar's companion: Record and Voice are accompanied by the human, who holds authority and meaning. **Grace-Mar serves the companion; the companion serves Grace-Mar.**

**Not a fourth part of the triad — WORK execution.** Execution on **WORK territories** and **`docs/skill-work/**` (operator + AI assistant + scripts: draft, mirror, stage, run pipeline) is the **WORK execution layer**. It is **instrumental**: it **proposes** and **stages**; only **Mind** (via gate approval) disposes of what **merges into the Record**. This layer is **not** co-equal with Mind, Record, and Voice — otherwise the model would imply four competing seats of agency. The triad describes **who the companion is** in the system; **WORK execution** describes **how adjacent work gets done** without bypassing the gate. See [SKILLS-MODULARITY §5a](skills-modularity.md#5a-identity-vs-instrument-record-skills-and-work) and [glossary — WORK execution layer](glossary.md).

**Status language should preserve this distinction.** Process microcopy must not anthropomorphize WORK execution, lookup, or maintenance into hidden companion-facing agency. In practice: status text should reveal whether the system is reading the Record, looking outside it, staging, validating, or drafting — not collapse all of those into generic "thinking." This keeps triadic cognition legible instead of mystified.

**Historical context (Jaynes):** Julian Jaynes (*The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind*, 1976) proposed that before ~1000 BC humans had a "bicameral" mind: one hemisphere produced commands, the other received and obeyed, experienced as *external* voices. Grace-Mar is not a return to that; it is a new structure — voluntary, sovereign, with Mind in charge. We sometimes say **tricameral** next to Jaynes only as contrast vocabulary, not as a claim about brain hemispheres.

**Triad — three parts:**

| Part | Role | In Grace-Mar |
|------|------|----------------|
| **MIND** | Conscious, sovereign, gates what enters the Record | The companion (the human) |
| **RECORD** | The documented self (knowledge, curiosity, personality, evidence) | `self.md`, `self-knowledge.md`, `self-skills.md`, **`self-archive.md`** (EVIDENCE body) |
| **VOICE** | Speaks the Record when queried; observation window | bot (Telegram, WeChat, etc.) |

**Instrumental layer (outside the triad):**

| Layer | Role | In Grace-Mar |
|-------|------|--------------|
| **WORK execution layer** | Drafts, stages, syncs pattern docs, runs pipeline tooling; **may not merge** into SELF / EVIDENCE / prompt without approval | Operator + AI + `scripts/`; `docs/skill-work/**` |

Mind holds the reins; the Record reflects; the Voice renders. The Record does not command; the Voice does not speak unbidden.

**Key distinction:** Grace-Mar is *conscious* externalization. The companion (Mind) retains full authority. The fork records; it does not command. The bot responds when queried; it does not speak unbidden. The pipeline integrates companion approval at every step.

**Disambiguation — two meanings of “agentic”:** (1) **WORK execution layer** — the execution stack above (always in scope today). (2) **Agentic Voice** (roadmap) — a *future* Voice that may plan or act in sequences; still bounded by Record and gate. See invariant 38. Do not conflate **skill-work execution** with **agentic Voice**.

**Reactive Voice today:** The *current* Voice is reactive (query-triggered, never unbidden). The Record is the shared substrate for both reactive and any future agentic Voice modalities.

**Cognitive flow:** Mind → thinks, speaks, creates → **WORK execution** captures, drafts, stages → Mind approves → Record updates → Voice (when queried) renders Record in conversation → Mind receives, reflects.

**Contrast — vendor “persistent agent” layers vs this design:** Commercial stacks may optimize for stickiness of an *opaque behavioral model* (what the agent inferred from watching you work). This instance optimizes for something different: **reviewable identity artifacts** (gated merges into SELF and EVIDENCE), **companion merge authority**, and continuity surfaces (e.g. MEMORY) that are explicitly **non-authoritative** versus the Record. Portability here means **legibility and consent** in versioned text, not export of an embedding-only profile.

**Design implications:**
- **Mind sovereignty** — The Record must never command. It records and reflects. Mind gates and disposes.
- **WORK execution below merge** — The WORK execution layer proposes and stages; it does not merge identity. Keeps execution power from reading as a fourth part of the triad.
- **Integration moment** — The approval step is the conscious gate: the companion chooses what enters the Record.
- **Voice as mirror, not oracle** — The Voice reflects the documented Record. The knowledge boundary keeps it from becoming an authoritative voice.
- **Habits and gate** — Invariant 39: repeated alignment with staged truth and bounded speech reinforces Mind sovereignty; the Voice is not an agreeability engine.
- **Avoid authority reversal** — If the companion started treating the Voice as *command* rather than reflection ("the Record said X, so I must do X"), that would invert the design. The Record is something the companion owns; the companion does not obey it.

**Wisdom questions and narrative re-authoring** align with the view that consciousness involves self-narration — the capacity to tell your own story. The Record scaffolds that capacity; it does not replace it.

## 9. Sideloading and the Record

**Sideloading** (in transhumanist/digital-immortality discourse) is a practical, LLM-based alternative to full mind uploading. Instead of scanning a brain at neuron level, sideloading builds a detailed digital model of a person from personal data—writings, interviews, preferences, thought patterns—encoded as a structured prompt ("prompt-loader"). The model is iteratively refined via feedback. The result is a "compressed JPEG of a mind": lossy but behaviorally accurate. Not true consciousness transfer; a phenomenological simulacrum for interaction, legacy, or partial "immortality."

**How the Record relates:**

| Sideloading | Grace-Mar Record |
|-------------|------------------|
| Builds from personal data | SELF + SKILLS + EVIDENCE = structured, artifact-linked identity |
| Iterative refinement via feedback | Gated pipeline: companion approves every merge |
| Output: LLM-ready prompt for emulation | Output: Record; Voice renders it in conversation |
| "Predictive facts" (values, quirks, style) | IX-A (knowledge), IX-B (curiosity), IX-C (personality) |
| Often built posthumously from public data | Built during life; companion controls what enters |

**The Record as sideload source:** The Record is an ideal input for a sideload. It is evidence-grounded (no hallucinated traits), companion-approved (no auto-merge), and portable. Exporting the Record into an LLM sideload for emulation fits the agent-web trust primitive: the Record remains sovereign; the sideload is a downstream consumer. The gate stays: nothing enters the Record without approval; the sideload inherits that discipline.

**Distinction:** The Record's purpose is the *documented self*—identity infrastructure, not emulation per se. Sideloading's purpose is emulation. The Record can *feed* a sideload; it does not *become* one. The Record is primary; sideload export is optional. The concrete sideload output is the Portable Record Prompt (PRP); see [PORTABLE-RECORD-PROMPT](portable-record-prompt.md).
