# Merging Upgrades from Companion-Self (Template → Instance)

**Purpose:** Grace-Mar is a private **instance** and working tool; companion-self is the upstream **template** repo and live public/open-source product surface. When the template is updated (concept, protocol, seed, schema), this doc describes how to pull those changes into grace-mar without overwriting the Record. Structural improvements proven inside grace-mar may later be generalized back into companion-self, but instance data and private workflows remain in grace-mar. See [COMPANION-SELF-BOOTSTRAP](../archive/grace-mar-instance/bootstrap/companion-self-bootstrap.md) §5 for the contract. For a side-by-side overview of instance vs template, see [grace-mar vs companion-self](grace-mar-vs-companion-self.md).

**Workspace boundary:** All grace-mar modifications—including merges from companion-self—are done in **this (grace-mar) workspace**. Do not edit grace-mar from a companion-self workspace; there, grace-mar is read-only reference. When you perform the merge checklist below, you are in the grace-mar workspace; companion-self is pulled or opened for reference only. See companion-self [COMPANION-SELF-BOOTSTRAP](https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self/blob/main/companion-self-bootstrap.md) §7.

## Architecture at a glance

Template → instance sync in grace-mar uses **four layers**, each with a different job:

| Layer | Canonical surface | What it answers |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Doctrine** | This file + [`archive/how-instances-consume-upgrades.md`](archive/how-instances-consume-upgrades.md) + [`template-sync-status.md`](template-sync-status.md) | What may sync, what must never sync, and what counts as approved local divergence |
| **Contract** | [`../platform/config/instance-contract.json`](../platform/config/instance-contract.json) | What upstream template version / commit grace-mar is targeting |
| **Applied provenance** | [`../platform/template/template-source.json`](../platform/template/template-source.json) | Which upstream commit was actually merged most recently, by whom, and on which paths |
| **Audit / merge workflow** | [`skill-work/work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md`](skill-work/work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md) + [`../scripts/template_diff.py`](../scripts/template_diff.py) + this checklist | What currently differs and which slice should be reconciled next |

**Important split:** [`../platform/config/instance-contract.json`](../platform/config/instance-contract.json) is the **target** contract. [`../platform/template/template-source.json`](../platform/template/template-source.json) is the **applied** provenance record. They may differ temporarily during intentional drift or staged catch-up work; do not collapse them into one concept.

---

## 0. Editable companion-self from this repo (multi-root + `template_diff`)

1. **Clone or submodule** the template into **`companion-self/`** at the root of this repository (sibling to `archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/`, `docs/`, etc.):
   - **Clone (simplest):** `git clone https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self.git companion-self`
   - **Submodule (tracked pin):** remove `/companion-self/` from `.gitignore` if present, then  
     `git submodule add https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self.git companion-self`  
     and commit the submodule metadata.
2. **Open the multi-root workspace** in Cursor / VS Code: **File → Open Workspace from File…** → choose **`.vscode/grace-mar.code-workspace`**. You get **strategy-codex** (repo root via `..` from the workspace file) and optional **companion-self** (`../companion-self`) when that clone exists.
3. **Template workspace filename (companion-self repo only):** If the upstream template still uses a long name such as `companion-self-and-grace-mar.code-workspace`, rename it in **companion-self** to `companion-self.code-workspace` or `template.code-workspace` and update template README links there. Grace-mar’s own workspace file stays **`.vscode/grace-mar.code-workspace`**. See [naming-convention.md](naming-convention.md).
4. **Template diff default path:** `python scripts/template_diff.py` uses **`./companion-self`** (under the grace-mar repo root). Override with `--companion-self /path` or **`GRACE_MAR_COMPANION_SELF`**. If `companion-self/` is missing and clone is enabled, the script still clones into that path (same as before).

The default clone-on-miss behavior targets **`./companion-self`** instead of `/tmp/companion-self`, so edits and diffs stay inside your tree when you use the workspace file.

**Session harvest (`harvest` skill):** Upstream **companion-self** is the canonical home for `.cursor/skills/harvest/`, `continuity/cadence/harvest-packet-contract.md`, and related **work-cadence** README edits. After landing there, reconcile into grace-mar with `template_diff.py` / operator **EXECUTE** scope — see [work-cadence README](skill-work/work-cadence/README.md) (section *Fourth operator tool: cross-agent extraction*).

## 1. Sync classes and template surfaces

Use these three classes whenever you decide whether a path should sync, mirror, or stay local.

| Sync class | Meaning | Typical handling |
|------------|---------|------------------|
| **Canonical template surfaces** | Portable template docs, schemas, validators, and scaffolds that grace-mar usually wants close to upstream | Track upstream closely; compare against companion-self and refresh deliberately |
| **Mirrored-but-adapted surfaces** | Files that map to a template concept but carry grace-mar-specific elaboration or reference-implementation detail | Hand-merge only; never bulk overwrite |
| **Instance-only surfaces** | Live Record, platform/deployment/runtime configuration, local operator workflows, and product-specific implementation | Never part of template parity |

### Canonical template surfaces (safe to sync)

Use the live template repo's manifest and upgrade docs as the source of truth. Grace-mar keeps local copies or instance-specific equivalents where useful, but not every template path must exist verbatim in the instance. **When companion-self adds or renames files, update this section and the audit.**

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `platform/template/template-manifest.json` | Authoritative template inventory; use this first when checking what the template now contains |
| `template-version.json` | Template version / release marker for recording sync baseline |
| `how-instances-consume-upgrades.md` | Companion-self's instance upgrade contract; compare with this doc when drift appears |
| `docs/concept.md` | Template concept doc; grace-mar may mirror this into its broader concept docs rather than a same-named file |
| `docs/status-microcopy.md` | Template status/process language framework; sync the doc first, then adapt locally to grace-mar’s Record/Voice/gate semantics |
| `docs/identity-fork-protocol.md` | Protocol: stage → approve → merge; evidence linkage (template **short form**; see IFP note below) |
| `docs/seed-phase.md` | Template seed-phase definition; grace-mar currently expresses this through ARCHITECTURE and operator docs |
| `docs/long-term-objective.md` | Template-level long-term objective / system rule |
| `docs/two-hour-screentime-target.md` | Template-level screen time constraint / philosophy |
| `docs/instance-patterns.md` | Template guidance for instance variants and advanced patterns |
| `platform/template/` | Template scaffold for new instances; reference-only in grace-mar (do not copy into ``) |
| `docs/CONTRADICTION-ENGINE-SPEC.md`, `docs/contradiction-resolution.md`, `docs/approval-inbox-spec.md` | Contradiction engine + gate review surface; grace-mar has instance-specific copies—compare on sync |
| `docs/change-review.md`, `docs/contradiction-policy.md`, `docs/change-types.md`, `docs/change-review-lifecycle.md` | Change-review doctrine (post-seed); `platform/template/template-manifest.json` → `change_review` |
| `docs/change-review-validation.md` | Operator doc: validation rules and commands for `validate-change-review.py` (grace-mar may mirror under `docs/` for instance operators) |
| `schemas/registry/change-*.v1.json`, `schemas/registry/identity-diff.v1.json` | Change-review JSON Schemas; listed under `change_review.schemas` in the manifest |
| Grace-mar mirrors | Same four doctrine files under `docs/` (banner points to template); schemas under `docs/schemas/` (`change-proposal.v1.json`, …, `identity-diff.v1.json`) for local tooling and diffs |
| Grace-mar equivalents | `docs/conceptual-framework.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/self-template.md`, `docs/skills-template.md`, `docs/evidence-template.md`, `docs/memory-template.md`, `AGENTS.md` remain valid instance-side mirrors or elaborations when aligned conceptually |
| Instance naming | [naming-convention.md](naming-convention.md) — lowercase docs, reserved `AGENTS.md`, OpenClaw export path, template workspace note |

### Mirrored-but-adapted surfaces

These map to template concepts, but grace-mar deliberately carries more detail or a different filename shape:

- [`identity-fork-protocol.md`](identity-fork-protocol.md) — grace-mar full reference implementation vs companion-self short form
- [`CONTRADICTION-ENGINE-SPEC.md`](CONTRADICTION-ENGINE-SPEC.md) and [`approval-inbox-spec.md`](approval-inbox-spec.md) — portable baseline upstream, longer instance elaboration locally
- [`conceptual-framework.md`](conceptual-framework.md) and [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) — instance-side expansions of template concept/protocol ideas
- local mirrors under `docs/schemas/` when grace-mar needs schema copies for local tooling

### Instance-only surfaces

**Never overwrite with template:** `` (the Record), instance-specific archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/config (e.g. Telegram token, render.yaml), PRP output paths (e.g. grace-mar-llm.txt), runtime/deployment surfaces, and local operator docs such as PROFILE-DEPLOY, NAMECHEAP-GUIDE, OPERATOR-WEEKLY-REVIEW unless you explicitly promote them upstream.

**Useful rule:** Treat `grace-mar` as the proving ground and `companion-self` as the reusable base. If a change is structural and instance-agnostic, it may be a candidate to merge back upstream later. If it depends on live Record state, private operator routines, or local deployment quirks, keep it instance-only.

**Current alignment note:** The live companion-self repo contains template-only paths that do not need one-to-one copies in grace-mar, but they do need explicit acknowledgment in audits and sync notes. Use `docs/skill-work/work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md` as the current path-level reference until a newer diff is generated.

### Manifest authority note

Inside grace-mar, [`../platform/template/template-manifest.json`](../platform/template/template-manifest.json) is a **cached audit mirror** of companion-self’s canonical manifest. The **canonical** template inventory still lives upstream at the companion-self commit you are targeting or have last applied. Use the local copy for operator visibility and diff convenience, but treat the upstream manifest at the pinned commit as the final source of truth when audit conflicts appear.

### Identity Fork Protocol (IFP) — short form vs full spec

Companion-self ships **`docs/identity-fork-protocol.md` as a short-form summary** with a pointer to the reference implementation. Grace-mar holds the **canonical full IFP v1.0** at the same path (`docs/identity-fork-protocol.md`) — much longer, normative for this instance. **Do not overwrite** grace-mar’s file with the template short form during template→instance sync. If the template summary changes, merge **selective** clarifications by hand, or promote an updated full spec to companion-self only as a deliberate release. Upstream link in the template must target `docs/identity-fork-protocol.md` (not a legacy `IDENTITY-FORK-PROTOCOL.md` filename).

**Template diff:** [`skill-work/work-companion-self/expected-template-drift.json`](skill-work/work-companion-self/expected-template-drift.json) lists this path so `scripts/template_diff.py` classifies it as expected drift (not an actionable differ).

### Status microcopy — docs-first sync

Companion-self’s **`docs/status-microcopy.md`** is the upstream source of truth for lane-aware status/loading/process language. Grace-mar should sync the **doc** and then adapt its wording in local architecture/chat-first/harness docs where triadic cognition, gating, and chat-first constraints require narrower language.

For the first pass:

- treat the **doc** as the canonical sync surface
- treat `companion-self/platform/app/` as an **optional implementation surface**, not the default downstream sync target
- do not assume `platform/app/public/*.html` or `platform/app/public/assets/app.js` should propagate to grace-mar just because the wording framework exists
- if the framework later needs manifest-driven audit coverage by default, add the **doc path** deliberately rather than using `platform/app/` as the canonical mechanism

---

## 2. Merge checklist

Use this when you have updates in companion-self that should flow into grace-mar.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Check target contract** — Read [`../platform/config/instance-contract.json`](../platform/config/instance-contract.json) so you know the intended upstream version / commit grace-mar is trying to match. |
| 2 | **Get template state** — Clone or pull companion-self (e.g. `git clone https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self.git companion-self` at repo root per §0, or another path with `GRACE_MAR_COMPANION_SELF`). Note the commit or tag you're syncing from. |
| 3 | **Read template inventory** — Check `template-manifest.json`, `template-version.json`, and `how-instances-consume-upgrades.md` in companion-self so you know the current upstream surface before comparing individual files. |
| 4 | **Diff mapped paths** — Compare template files with grace-mar's same-name copies or instance-side equivalents. `docs/skill-work/work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md` and `scripts/template_diff.py --use-manifest` can help. Add `--include-skill-work` only when you intentionally want the larger WORK-tree audit. |
| 5 | **Choose sync class** — For each changed path, decide whether it is canonical, mirrored-but-adapted, or instance-only before copying anything. |
| 6 | **Merge into grace-mar** — For each area where the template is ahead, update grace-mar's mirrored file or instance-side equivalent. Resolve any instance-specific additions in grace-mar (keep them). Do **not** overwrite `` or instance config. |
| 7 | **Validate** — Run `python scripts/validate-integrity.py --user grace-mar --json` and `python scripts/governance_checker.py`. Fix any breakage. |
| 8 | **Check target vs applied metadata** — Run `python scripts/validate_template_sync_contract.py`. This should fail on structural inconsistency and warn only when target/applied drift is intentional. |
| 9 | **Record applied provenance** — Update [`../platform/template/template-source.json`](../platform/template/template-source.json) with the upstream commit, version, date, and paths that were actually merged. This file records the **applied** state, not just the desired target. |
| 10 | **Log the sync** — Record in §3 (Template sync log) the date, companion-self commit/tag or template version, and paths updated. |

---

## 2a. Merge slice — routine template hygiene

When companion-self moves quickly, prefer **small, scoped merges** over rare “catch-up” merges. Each slice should be one reviewable purpose (e.g. one doc, one schema file, one script), then log §3 and commit with the **template SHA** in the commit body.

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | **Pin** — `git -C companion-self pull` (or fetch); note `HEAD` and `template-version.json` (`templateVersion`, `gitTag`). If this changes the intended target, update [`../platform/config/instance-contract.json`](../platform/config/instance-contract.json) deliberately. |
| 2 | **Diff** — `python3 scripts/template_diff.py --use-manifest -o docs/skill-work/work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md` for exact manifest scope; add `--include-skill-work` only when you want the larger WORK-tree audit. |
| 3 | **Choose one slice** — e.g. one `docs/` file, `schemas/registry/` file, or validator; skip `platform/app/` unless you run the template student app. |
| 4 | **Merge by hand** — copy or edit per §2; never bulk-overwrite ``. |
| 5 | **Validate** — `python3 scripts/validate-integrity.py --user grace-mar --json`; run merged validators if you pulled them (e.g. `validate-change-review.py` on demo paths). |
| 6 | **Check metadata split** — `python3 scripts/validate_template_sync_contract.py`; use `--require-target-applied-match` only if you intentionally want the stronger rule for a full convergence pass. |
| 7 | **Record + log** — update [`../platform/template/template-source.json`](../platform/template/template-source.json) with the applied merge slice, then add the §3 row. Narrow sync-pack refreshes should append an auxiliary event rather than replace the top-level applied provenance. |

**Alignment triage:** For governance-first review (behavior vs wording-only diffs, manifest rhythm, optional DESIGN/validator upstream), see [work-companion-self/README.md § Three-track alignment](skill-work/work-companion-self/README.md#three-track-alignment-operator-policy).

**Operator verification (ongoing):** There is **no** `validate-template-sync.py` in companion-self as of template **0.4.0**; template **manifest integrity** is `node scripts/validate-template.js` (see companion-self `how-instances-consume-upgrades.md` § Auditability). Instances record **target contract** in [`../platform/config/instance-contract.json`](../platform/config/instance-contract.json) and **applied provenance** in [`../platform/template/template-source.json`](../platform/template/template-source.json); do not assume tools from informal narratives until they exist on `main`.

| 2026-03-26 | companion-self **`main` @ `87628a5`** (manifest diff only) | **Refreshed:** [work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md](skill-work/work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md) via `python3 scripts/template_diff.py --use-manifest -o …`. Not a content merge from template. |
| 2026-03-23 | companion-self **`main` @ `288b438`** | **Merged:** removed operator-books symlink template governance (`platform/template/self-library.md` + example corpus doc). [Commit](https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self/commit/288b4386684e076df894536624308e69305ae229). Grace-mar: [COMPANION-SELF-museum library shelf-ALIGNMENT.md](skill-work/work-companion-self/TEMPLATE-BASELINE.md), [TEMPLATE-BASELINE](skill-work/work-companion-self/TEMPLATE-BASELINE.md). |
| *(baseline for governance merges)* | **`288b438`** | Recorded in [TEMPLATE-BASELINE.md](skill-work/work-companion-self/TEMPLATE-BASELINE.md). Re-run manifest diff after each material template pull; `main` tip may advance beyond this pin. |

## 4. Diff script (implemented)

[`scripts/template_diff.py`](../scripts/template_diff.py) compares companion-self and grace-mar:

- Default template root: `$GRACE_MAR_COMPANION_SELF` or `./companion-self` (see §0); clones shallow `main` if missing unless `--no-clone`.
- **`--use-manifest`** — exact paths from companion-self `template-manifest.json`.
- **`--include-skill-work`** — optional recursive pass over `docs/skill-work/` in both repos when you want the larger WORK-tree audit.
- **`--output <file>`** — write the report; commit [work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md](skill-work/work-companion-self/audit-report-manifest.md) when refreshing the audit.

It **does not** overwrite instance files; operator merges by hand per §2.

When an operator or agent runs a **template + boundary audit** (e.g. `coffee` **A**; legacy hey **A** still works), the narrative should close with **specific upstream / downstream recommendations for reconciliation code** — `scripts/`, validators, CI, hooks — not only doc drift. Spec: [work-companion-self/README — Reconciliation code audit](skill-work/work-companion-self/README.md#reconciliation-code-audit-upstream-and-downstream).

## 5. Deciding whether a Grace-Mar change should go upstream

Use this checklist before proposing an instance-side improvement back to `companion-self`.

| Question | If yes | If no |
|------|--------|-------|
| Is the change reusable across many future instances? | Candidate for upstreaming | Keep in `grace-mar` |
| Does it avoid ``, private artifacts, and instance-only config? | Candidate for upstreaming | Keep in `grace-mar` |
| Can it be described without Abby/Grace-Mar-specific context? | Candidate for upstreaming | Generalize first or keep local |
| Is it governance, schema, docs, tooling, bootstrap, or sync logic? | Strong upstream candidate | Review carefully |
| Is it a private operating habit or one-off workflow for this instance? | Probably instance-only | Keep in `grace-mar` |

If mixed, split the change: upstream the reusable layer to `companion-self`; keep the instance-specific layer in `grace-mar`.
