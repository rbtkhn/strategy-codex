# Telegram Mini App Setup

**Channel roles:**
- **HTML profile** — Read-only. View identity, pipeline, SKILLS, benchmarks. No input, no chat.
- **Telegram** — Bidirectional. User and Grace-Mar exchange messages; "we did X" invokes the pipeline. The primary conversation channel.

Grace-Mar has several web surfaces on the Mini App host (plus the static dashboard):

- **Dashboard** — Full profile view (Knowledge, Skills, Curiosity, Personality, Library, Disclosure). **Browser only, read-only.** Available at **https://grace-mar.com**.
- **Q&A Mini App** — Interactive Q&A with Grace-Mar. Runs as a **Telegram Mini App** and can also be opened in a browser. Bidirectional (ask questions, get answers).
- **Family hub** — `/app` on the Mini App server: chat, log activities (“we did X”), and parent-gated review + merge. See below.
- **Work-politics internal dashboard** — `/pol` (legacy `/wap`): token-gated job tracker (SMM + operator). See [pol-dashboard.md](pol-dashboard.md).

## Architecture

| Surface | Host | URL | Purpose |
|---------|------|-----|---------|
| Dashboard (HTML) | grace-mar.com | **https://grace-mar.com** | Read-only — view profile, pipeline, SKILLS, disclosure |
| Q&A Mini App | Render / Railway / your host | e.g. `https://grace-mar.onrender.com/` | Bidirectional — ask Grace-Mar questions, see her voice |

The **profile** is at **https://grace-mar.com**. Set `PROFILE_MINIAPP_URL` (or `DASHBOARD_MINIAPP_URL`) to **https://grace-mar.com** so the Telegram menu button opens the profile. (If you prefer the menu button to open the Q&A Mini App instead, set it to that URL.)

## 1. Dashboard (browser-only, read-only)

The profile is available at **https://grace-mar.com**. Generate the static HTML with `scripts/generate_profile.py`; deploy via GitHub Pages (point grace-mar.com at the Pages site) or serve from your own host. **Full steps:** [profile-deploy.md](profile-deploy.md).

Generate and deploy:

```bash
python3 scripts/generate_profile.py
```

Push to `main` or run the workflow manually. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` generates the profile and deploys `platform/profile/` to the `gh-pages` branch. Enable GitHub Pages in the repo (Settings → Pages → Source: Deploy from branch → branch: `gh-pages`, folder: `/ (root)`). Point **grace-mar.com** at the Pages site (Settings → Pages → Custom domain) so the profile lives at https://grace-mar.com.

## 2. Q&A Mini App (Mini App + API)

The Q&A app consists of:

- Static UI: `platform/miniapp/index.html`
- API: `POST /api/ask` with `{ "message": "..." }` → `{ "response": "..." }`
- Server: `platform/apps/miniapp_server.py` serves both

### Run locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... python platform/apps/miniapp_server.py
```

Open http://localhost:5000 for the Q&A Mini App. For the **family hub**, set `FAMILY_APP_TOKEN` in `.env`, restart, then open http://localhost:5000/app and paste the token (or use `/app?t=<token>` once).

### Local dev boundary: running with companion-self

It is normal to run the Grace-Mar Mini App and the companion-self demo at the same time:

- **Grace-Mar Mini App / family hub**: `http://localhost:5000`
- **companion-self demo app**: `http://localhost:3000`

These are **different browser origins** because the port differs. In practice:

- `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, service workers, and IndexedDB stay **separate** between `3000` and `5000`
- page-relative requests such as `/api/ask` or `/api/activity` go to the **same origin as the page you opened**
- a token saved by the Grace-Mar family hub on `5000` does **not** appear in the companion-self demo on `3000`
- running both at once does **not** by itself explain app-specific 404s or API errors; those are usually route/runtime bugs inside one server

Practical rule: treat them as two local islands that happen to share the same machine. If you want one frontend to call the other server intentionally, use an absolute URL and handle CORS on purpose.

**Cookie caveat:** cookies are less cleanly separated because they are host-based rather than port-based. Current local-dev auth in these surfaces mostly uses browser storage and explicit headers/tokens, so cross-port confusion should be low unless you add cookie-based auth later.

**Sync policy note:** this local-dev split is also the architecture split. Grace-Mar’s `platform/miniapp/` and family/operator surfaces are instance deployment code, not a default file-for-file mirror of `companion-self/platform/app/`. Template app code is an optional parity surface; docs/specs remain the normal upstream sync vehicle unless you intentionally choose implementation parity.

For Telegram testing, expose with ngrok:

```bash
ngrok http 5000
```

### Deploy (Railway / Render)

**Railway**

1. Connect the repo.
2. Root directory = repo root. Railway uses `procfile` and `requirements.txt`.
3. Set env: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `PORT` (optional, Railway sets it).
4. Deploy. Use the generated URL (e.g. `https://grace-mar-qa.railway.app`).

**Render**

- **Option A — Blueprint:** Add `render.yaml` to your repo. In Render Dashboard → New → Blueprint, connect the repo. Both the Mini App (web) and the bot (worker) will be created. Set env vars in each service’s Environment tab.
- **Option B — Manual:** New Web Service, connect repo. Build: `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Start: `python platform/apps/miniapp_server.py`. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, and optionally `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GRACE_MAR_REPO`.

### Archive (session transcript)

Mini App exchanges are appended to `<user>/session-transcript.md` (real-time log, same policy as Telegram). SELF-ARCHIVE is updated only when candidates are merged via `process_approved_candidates` (gated). No GitHub token is required for archiving.

On Render, the filesystem is ephemeral, so SESSION-TRANSCRIPT written by the Mini App is lost between deploys unless you add a separate step to persist it (e.g. push to repo). Local dev writes to disk as usual.

**Operator Console — merge from browser:** Gate tab and Inbox can run **Merge approved (companion)** / **(all)** / **(work-politics territory)**, which invokes `process_approved_candidates` on the server. That requires a **writable clone** of the repo; ephemeral-only hosts may fail merges. Use the CLI from your laptop, or attach a persistent disk, if web merge errors out.

### Family hub (`/app`)

**Env:** Set **`FAMILY_APP_TOKEN`** to a long random string (same host as `platform/apps/miniapp_server.py`). Optional bookmark: `https://<host>/app?t=<FAMILY_APP_TOKEN>` — the app stores the token in the browser after the first load.

**APIs (require header `X-Family-Token: <FAMILY_APP_TOKEN>`):**

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `POST /api/family/activity` | Body `{ "text": "we read …" }` — stages like Telegram “we did X” (`channel_key`: `web:family`). |
| `GET /api/family/pending-count` | Pending candidate count (for badges). |
| `POST /api/family/ask` | Same shape as `POST /api/ask` — Voice chat; archives to session-transcript. |

**Review tab:** Parent enters **`OPERATOR_FETCH_SECRET`** once per browser session; then uses the same gate + merge-approved flow as [Operator Console](operator-console.md). Kids do not need the operator secret for Chat or Log.

**Security:** Anyone with `FAMILY_APP_TOKEN` can chat and submit activities (rate-limit at reverse proxy if needed). Rotate the token if the link leaks. Merge still requires the operator secret.

### Work-politics internal dashboard (`/pol`)

**Env:** Set **`POL_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`** (or legacy **`WAP_DASHBOARD_TOKEN`**) to a long random string. Optional **`POL_JOBS_PATH`** / **`WAP_JOBS_PATH`** — absolute path or path relative to repo root for the jobs JSON file (default `data/wap_jobs.json`). On Render, jobs are **ephemeral** unless you mount a persistent disk and point the jobs path there.

**Use:** Open `https://<host>/pol?t=<token>` (token is stored in the browser session). Create jobs, paste Cursor outputs, update status. **Full spec:** [pol-dashboard.md](pol-dashboard.md).

## 3. Bot (Webhook Mode)

The `render.yaml` blueprint runs the Telegram bot via **webhook** on the miniapp service (no separate worker). Set these env vars on the **miniapp** service:

- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` — from @BotFather (when set, webhook is enabled)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `PROFILE_MINIAPP_URL` — URL opened by the Telegram menu button (e.g. **https://grace-mar.com** for the platform/profile); `DASHBOARD_MINIAPP_URL` still supported
- Session transcript is written locally; SELF-ARCHIVE is updated only on merge (no GITHUB_TOKEN needed for archiving).

See [TELEGRAM-WEBHOOK-SETUP](telegram-webhook-setup.md) for details and migration from polling.

## 4. Bot env (local)

When running the bot locally, set in `archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/.env`:

```env
PROFILE_MINIAPP_URL=https://grace-mar.com
# or DASHBOARD_MINIAPP_URL=https://grace-mar.com
# Optional: base URL for Operator Console hints after Telegram approve (/merge)
# GRACE_MAR_OPERATOR_CONSOLE_URL=https://your-miniapp-host.example.com
```

This URL is opened when the user taps the Telegram menu button (Profile). Set it to **https://grace-mar.com** so the profile is one tap away. On Render, set the same var in the bot service’s Environment tab.

## 5. @BotFather (optional)

In @BotFather → Bot Settings → Menu Button:

- Set URL to **https://grace-mar.com** (or whatever URL you set in `PROFILE_MINIAPP_URL` or `DASHBOARD_MINIAPP_URL`).

## 6. Deep linking

Use `startapp` to open the Q&A app:

- `t.me/your_bot?startapp=` — opens the Q&A Mini App.

## Security

- The Q&A API is stateless and uses the same `SYSTEM_PROMPT` as the bot. No profile writes from the Mini App.
- For production, consider rate limiting and `initData` validation (HMAC-SHA-256 with bot token) if you need user verification.
