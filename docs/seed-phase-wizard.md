# Seed Phase Wizard & Good Morning Brief (grace-mar)

**Purpose:** Operator-facing bootstrap and daily start ritual under canonical instance paths. **Governed by:** gated pipeline — these tools do **not** write `self.md`, `self-archive.md`, or `archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/prompt.py`; durable Record changes use [identity-fork-protocol.md](identity-fork-protocol.md).

**Orientation:** For companion vs operator, the triad, and why merges wait for approval, see [start-here.md](start-here.md)—use **[Choose your path](start-here.md#choose-your-path)** (A–F) before long reads. For structured seed questions that map to JSON artifacts, see [seed-phase-survey.md](seed-phase-survey.md), including **[Calibrate from your start-here path](seed-phase-survey.md#calibrate-from-your-start-here-path)** so question order matches who is in the room.

**Template alignment:** Companion-self **Seed Phase v2** (JSON artifacts + schemas) is documented separately; see [companion-self-seed-phase-v2-mapping.md](companion-self-seed-phase-v2-mapping.md) for how this wizard relates to that protocol.

## Canonical stage mapping (Seed Phase v2)

Companion-self defines **stages 0–7** as the portable formation pipeline ([companion-self `docs/seed-phase-stages.md`](https://github.com/rbtkhn/companion-self/blob/main/docs/seed-phase-stages.md)):

0. **Intake** — constraints, context, `seed_intake.json`
1. **Identity Scaffold** — `seed_identity.json`
2. **Curiosity Scaffold** — `seed_curiosity.json`
3. **Pedagogy Scaffold** — `seed_pedagogy.json`
4. **Expression Scaffold** — `seed_expression.json`
5. **Memory Contract** — `seed_memory_contract.json`
6. **Trial Interactions** — `seed_trial_report.json`
7. **Readiness Gate** — `seed_readiness.json`, dossier

**Wizard disclaimer:** `seed-phase-wizard.py` is an **instance** operator tool (reflection proposals, `seed/minimal-core.json`, MEMORY tone, completion marker). It **does not** emit the full template JSON set by itself. Use the mapping doc when reconciling wizard output with template validation or future export tooling.

**`start_here_pick` (A–F):** The wizard **does not** prompt for which [start-here Choose your path](start-here.md#choose-your-path) letter was used. That keeps the interactive flow lighter; optional **`start_here_pick`** on `seed_intake.json` is **operator-set by hand** when filling template JSON—see [seed-phase-survey — Calibrate](seed-phase-survey.md#calibrate-from-your-start-here-path). **Revisit:** add a wizard question only when in-repo tooling **reads** the field (e.g. dossier or automation).

## Scripts

| Script | Role |
|--------|------|
| [`scripts/seed-phase-wizard.py`](../scripts/seed-phase-wizard.py) | Interactive wizard: reflection-proposals, `seed/minimal-core.json`, `memory.md` tone note, `SEED-PHASE-COMPLETED.json` |
| [`scripts/good-morning-brief.py`](../scripts/good-morning-brief.py) | Short morning ritual; optional daily intention file under `archive/queues/reflection-proposals/` |

Run from repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/seed-phase-wizard.py
python3 scripts/seed-phase-wizard.py -u my-fork
GRACE_MAR_USER_ID=my-fork python3 scripts/seed-phase-wizard.py
python3 scripts/seed-phase-wizard.py --require-proposal-class   # strict integrity (matches CI)
```

```bash
python3 scripts/good-morning-brief.py
python3 scripts/good-morning-brief.py -u grace-mar
python3 scripts/good-morning-brief.py --skip-warmup-prompt      # non-interactive / tests
```

## Paths created (under ``)

| Path | Record? | Notes |
|------|---------|--------|
| `archive/queues/reflection-proposals/SEED-founding-intent.md` | No | Operator narrative; promote via gate if needed |
| `archive/queues/reflection-proposals/SEED-initial-sparks.md` | No | Curiosity seed |
| `archive/queues/reflection-proposals/SEED-tensions-note.md` | No | Optional tensions annotation |
| `archive/queues/reflection-proposals/DAILY-INTENTION-YYYY-MM-DD.md` | No | Written by good-morning-brief |
| `seed/minimal-core.json` | No | **Facts listed here are not merged into museum knowledge section A** — stage LEARN / candidates |
| `memory.md` (append) | No (MEMORY) | Seed wizard appends good-morning tone; see [memory-template.md](memory-template.md) |
| `SEED-PHASE-COMPLETED.json` | No | Marker + suggested next steps |

There is **no** top-level `Record/` directory; evidence spine is `self-archive.md`.

---

## Validators (seed wizard step)

When `self.md`, `self-archive.md`, and `recursion-gate.md` all exist under ``, the wizard runs:

- `python3 scripts/validate-integrity.py --user <id>` (optional `--require-proposal-class`)
- `python3 scripts/governance_checker.py`

If the instance directory is incomplete, validators are **skipped** with a message (typical during early archive/grace-mar-instance/bootstrap).

---

## Full morning stack

For RECURSION-GATE state, session tail, and work-politics pulse, use the **operator cadence** skill and harness:

- [`.cursor/skills/coffee/SKILL.md`](../.cursor/skills/coffee/SKILL.md)
- `python3 scripts/harness_warmup.py -u <id> [--compact]`

The operator cadence flow can offer to run `harness_warmup` after the intention prompt.

## Template upstream

`companion-self` may adopt a variant of these scripts later. Instance sync contract: [merging-from-companion-self.md](merging-from-companion-self.md).
