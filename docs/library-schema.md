# LIBRARY Schema

**Purpose:** Governs the LIBRARY component — a curated store of approved sources Grace-Mar may return to for lookup, canon, and influence.

**Three lanes:**
1. **Reference** — Lookup-first sources Grace-Mar can draw on when answering questions.
2. **Canon** — Approved books, stories, and collections that belong in Grace-Mar's long-term intellectual world.
3. **Influence** — Media that has already shaped Grace-Mar's taste, curiosity, knowledge, or personality.

**See also:** [architecture.md](architecture.md), [id-taxonomy.md](id-taxonomy.md), EVIDENCE § I. READING LIST

## Relationship to Reading List

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **EVIDENCE Reading List (READ-*)** | Books Grace-Mar has *consumed* — evidence of what she's read |
| **LIBRARY** | Curated return-to store of references, canon works, and influential media |

A book can appear in both. LIBRARY is not only a reading log. It includes lookup sources, approved canon, and influential media.

---

## Entry Format

Each LIBRARY entry uses the **LIB-** prefix.

```yaml
entries:
  - id: 
    title: "Example Book Title"
    author: "Author Name"
    isbn: ""                      # optional: 10- or 13-digit ISBN (for lookup, disambiguation)
    lane: canon                   # reference | canon | influence
    type: book                    # book | story | article | reference | video | audio | other
    volume: ""                    # for type: story — the collection/container title
    status: active                # active | deprecated | archived
    scope: []                     # optional: topics this source covers (for query routing)
    engagement_status: planned    # planned | in_progress | consumed | recurring | available | trusted | primary
    read_id: null                 # optional: READ-XXXX if also in Reading List (evidence link)
    lookup_priority: low          # preferred | high | medium | low | none
    source: manual                # manual | path | url (for future RAG/indexing)
    url: ""                       # optional: canonical website, repository, or source page
    pd_url: ""                    # optional: Project Gutenberg, Wikisource, etc.
    shelf_intent: ""              # optional: canon | working_reference | operator_book | active_study | temporary_aid
    operator_subtype: ""          # optional: operator_spine | operator_notebook | operator_journal | upstream_corpus (when shelf_intent: operator_book)
    reviewed_at: ""               # optional: ISO date of last entry-level freshness review
    added_at: 2026-02-XX
    notes: ""                     # optional
```

## Lane Semantics

### `reference`
Lookup-first sources Grace-Mar may actively consult when answering questions.

Examples:
- encyclopedias
- atlases
- codices
- trusted reference videos

### `canon`
Approved cultural works that belong in Grace-Mar's long-term library, whether or not already consumed.

Examples:
- fairy tales
- myths
- classic stories
- story collections

### `influence`
Media already shaping Grace-Mar's tastes, curiosity, knowledge, or personality.

Examples:
- watched ballet performances
- bedtime music
- repeatedly returned-to videos
- important consumed books

---

## Maturity

Optional **maturity** field (1–3) aligns LIBRARY with lesson difficulty. Same scale is used in [lesson-rules-config](skill-work/lesson-rules-config.yaml) for LLM lesson scope.

| Value | Label | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1** | Early/young | Picture books, early readers, simple vocabulary |
| **2** | Intermediate | Retellings, short chapter books, edge Lexile |
| **3** | Advanced | Full texts, older literature, SAT-prep tier |

Lesson generator uses this scale to scope activity difficulty and to instruct which LIBRARY maturity to draw from for reading activities.

---

## Lookup Priority

Optional routing signal for runtime lookup.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **high** | First-stop source when scope matches |
| **medium** | Useful secondary source |
| **low** | Valid but not preferred for runtime lookup |
| **none** | Preserved for canon/influence, not used for active lookup routing |

---

## Shelf Intent

Optional field describing the entry's operational role in the library.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **canon** | Durable cultural or intellectual fixture; long-term retention; rarely reviewed for freshness. |
| **working_reference** | Actively consulted for lookup; reviewed when scope or accuracy changes. |
| **operator_book** | Operator-authored analytical corpus (e.g. Predictive History, strategy notebook, journals). Reference-facing; does not bypass gate for identity claims. |
| **active_study** | Currently being read, studied, or ingested; temporary elevated priority; review when engagement ends. |
| **temporary_aid** | Short-lived utility (e.g. a one-off reference for a specific task); archive candidate after use. |

When omitted, the entry's role is inferred from `lane` and `scope`. The field is most useful for operator books and entries with non-obvious retention expectations.

---

## Operator Subtype

Optional field for entries with `shelf_intent: operator_book`. Distinguishes retrieval object classes within the operator-book shelf.

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| **operator_spine** | Multivolume interpretive corpus with a stable structure (e.g. Predictive History). Deep, slow-changing, high retrieval weight. |
| **operator_notebook** | Active WORK-territory notebook with daily/episodic entries (e.g. strategy notebook). Fast-changing, session-coupled. |
| **operator_journal** | Process/learning journal (e.g. Cici notebook, dev journal). Reflective, lower retrieval weight than notebooks. |
| **upstream_corpus** | Large external corpus maintained outside this instance (e.g. Civilization Memory). High volume, separate freshness cycle. |

When omitted on an `operator_book` entry, the subtype is unspecified. The field helps review scripts and future UIs distinguish retrieval granularity, freshness expectations, and query suitability across operator-authored corpora.

---

## Entry Freshness

Optional `reviewed_at` field (ISO date) records when an entry was last checked for continued relevance, scope accuracy, and appropriate `lookup_priority`.

Most useful on `preferred` and `high` priority entries, where stale metadata has the highest routing impact. Entries with `lookup_priority: none` or `status: archived` rarely need freshness review.

**Review trigger:** `scripts/library_review_report.py` surfaces entries whose `reviewed_at` is missing or older than 30 days alongside `preferred`/`high` entries.

**Scope style note:** Each entry's `scope` list should include at least one narrow topic tag and at most one broad umbrella tag (e.g. `operator_analytical`) unless the entry genuinely spans multiple domains. Mixed scope taxonomies (topic + source class + lane in one list) are acceptable but should be internally consistent within a shelf.

---

## pd_url Notes

- For books based on public domain works: add URL to Project Gutenberg or Wikisource.
- Use for: direct retrieval, RAG indexing, faster lookup, reduced LLM knowledge leak.
- Author pages (e.g. `gutenberg.org/ebooks/author/37` for Dickens) used for "Complete" collections.

## ISBN Notes

- Store digits with or without hyphens. Normalize to ISBN-13 when both formats exist.
- Use for: catalog lookups (Open Library, WorldCat), disambiguation between editions, future RAG indexing.

---

## Lookup Order

When Grace-Mar receives a "look it up" request (Telegram archive/grace-mar-instance/bot):

1. Query active LIBRARY entries with `lane: reference` first
2. Then use active `canon` entries when relevant by scope
3. `influence` entries may inform tone, taste, or known exposure, but are not primary lookup sources unless explicitly intended
4. If no match is found (`LIBRARY_MISS`) → fall back to CMC, then full LOOKUP_PROMPT, then REPHRASE

Videos in LIBRARY can still contribute scope for routing, but the lane makes clear whether they are lookup sources, canon objects, or documented influences.

---

## Governance

- LIBRARY entries are added only through the gated pipeline or explicit user action
- Deprecating a source: set `status: deprecated`; do not delete (history preserved)
- Archiving a source: set `status: archived`; keep for history
- New entries get `added_at`; optional `evidence_tier` if linked to READ-*
- Canon and influence entries may remain active even when not primary lookup sources

---

## ID Allocation

LIB-* IDs are allocated sequentially. Next ID = max(LIB-*) + 1.
