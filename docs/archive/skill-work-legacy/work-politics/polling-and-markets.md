# Polling and prediction markets — KY-4 (operator)

**Purpose:** Standard **coffee** intel for the Massie shadow / work-politics lane: **horserace polling** (when it exists) and **prediction-market prices** (Polymarket). Legacy **hey** still works as the trigger alias. This is **operator WORK product**, not Record truth and not Voice knowledge.

**Last checked:** 2026-04-11

## Canonical surfaces (bookmark)

| Surface | URL | What it measures |
|--------|-----|-------------------|
| **Polymarket — GOP primary winner** | [polymarket.com/event/ky-04-republican-primary-winner](https://polymarket.com/event/ky-04-republican-primary-winner) | Implied probability per candidate (Massie, Gallrein, others); check **volume** on each outcome and total. |
| **Polymarket — general election (party)** | [polymarket.com/event/ky-04-house-election-winner](https://polymarket.com/event/ky-04-house-election-winner) | Republican vs Democratic **party** to win the seat (not candidate-specific); often **low volume** early — treat price as weak if vol ≈ 0. |

## When to run (agent)

Run this block **only** when:

- The operator chose **coffee menu C — Statecraft** and explicitly wants polling or market material converted into a lane-level statecraft object or downstream instrument (legacy **Strategist** wording may still appear in old notes), **or**
- The operator explicitly requested KY-4 / Polymarket / polls in the **same** message as coffee, **or**
- They asked ad hoc for a markets/polls refresh outside coffee.

**Do not** run as part of coffee **Step 1** (token discipline — [coffee skill](../../../.cursor/skills/coffee/SKILL.md) defers internet intel until **A — Daily Brief** or explicit request).

After `operator_daily_warmup.py` / `harness_warmup.py` when helpful for context, but **fetch/search steps** belong in the **A — Daily Brief** turn (or explicit request), not the first paste.

1. **Fetch** the two Polymarket URLs above (or equivalent fetch). Report **implied %** and **volume** from the **price row / order book**, not from Polymarket’s **AI “Market Context”** blurb (blurbs can be wrong on names, dates, and poll citations).
2. **Search** the public web for **independent** KY-4 primary polling: e.g. named pollsters, university polls, or major outlets reporting **toplines + methodology**. If none in the last ~30 days, say so plainly.
3. **Separate** (a) **campaign / internal** polls and **media repeating internals** vs (b) **public** polls with disclosed methodology. Never treat internals as equivalent to public surveys.
4. **Caveat block** in the reply: markets ≠ polls; liquidity matters; U.S. regulatory/access context for traders ≠ electorate.

## Weekly brief and registry

- Log notable shifts (big volume move, first public poll, etc.) in the weekly brief or session notes as needed.
- Registry row: [brief-source-registry.md](brief-source-registry.md) lists these surfaces under **watch** — update **Last checked** when you touch them.

---

## Guardrails

- **Cite** Polymarket and outlet URLs before any **client-facing** or **posted** use.
- Do not merge polling or market numbers into **SELF**, **EVIDENCE**, or **prompt** without the gated pipeline.
- Prediction markets can be **thin** or **manipulated** at small size; say so when volume is low.
