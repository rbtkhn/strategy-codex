# Brief source registry — work-politics

**Discovery (strategy lane):** [../work-strategy/brief-source-registry.md](../work-strategy/brief-source-registry.md) is a pointer stub only—**edit this file**, not the stub.

Structured intake surface for the weekly brief.

Update `Last checked` when you review a source. `Status` is for operator workflow, not Record truth.

## Recency pass (last 7–30 days)

**Goal:** At least one full pass of the brief where every external bullet is **grounded in the last 7–30 days** (not evergreen search).

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | Pick window: **7d** (tight) or **30d** (standard) for this cycle. |
| 2 | **Principal X** — scroll @RepThomasMassie for the window only; note dates on bullets. |
| 3 | **Opposition / race** — X search + one local outlet archive filtered by date; same window. |
| 4 | **National hooks** (Iran, votes, etc.) — filter Google News or trusted feed by **Past week** / **Past month**. |
| 5 | Log in brief: `Recency window: [7d \| 30d] · checked [date]` |

**Optional skill:** Install **Last 30 Days** (Matt Van Horn) in **your** coding agent if you want scripted social/recent-web pull; still **cite + companion approves** anything that becomes client-facing. Not Voice knowledge.

## Status meaning

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `ready` | Local doc/source is usable now |
| `watch` | External source to check during refresh |
| `needs_refresh` | Local doc exists but still needs human update before heavy reuse |
