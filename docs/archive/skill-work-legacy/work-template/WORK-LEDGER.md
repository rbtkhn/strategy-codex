# WORK-LEDGER — Generic lane ledger (scaffold)

**Status:** Template / scaffold  
**Scope:** Copy into `work-<id>/WORK-LEDGER.md` or specialize (e.g. [STRATEGY.md](../work-strategy/STRATEGY.md) for work-strategy).  
**Rule:** Additive-first. Do not silently rewrite durable lane memory. Preserve contradictions, revisions, and retirements explicitly.

**Governance — §V vs II-A / III-A / IV:** Treat **II-A** (active watches), **III-A** (framing watchlist), and **IV** (local execution / operator log) as **systems of record** for those entry types. Use **§V Promotion / retirement record** only as a **sparse changelog** (dates, pointers, “why promoted/retired”) — do not duplicate full watch entries in both II-A and V.

## II-A. ACTIVE WATCHES

*(Short-form entries for emerging patterns that persist across multiple reviews or materially affect operator attention.)*

**Entry format**

- **Watch:** short label  
- **First noticed:** YYYY-MM-DD  
- **Current status:** watch / escalating / promoted-to-ledger / retired _(align with [README glossary](README.md#glossary-lifecycle))_  
- **Latest evidence:** short note  
- **Framing note:** what model or comparison is helping  
- **Primary implication:** why the lane should care  
- **Contradiction / caution:** what may invalidate the watch  

**Entries**

- *(empty until used)*

---

## III. LEARNING LEDGER

*(Durable heuristics, extracted lessons, repeated operator judgments, and lane-specific procedural wisdom.)*

### Stable heuristics

- _TBD_

### Repeated lessons

- _TBD_

### Known anti-patterns

- _TBD_

### Deprecated / retired models

- _TBD_

---

## III-A. FRAMING WATCHLIST

*(Recurring frames, analogies, comparisons, or benchmark models used by the lane.)*

**Entry format**

- **Frame:** short label  
- **Last applied:** YYYY-MM-DD + context  
- **What it explains well:** short note  
- **Where it misleads:** short note  
- **Usefulness:** low / medium / high  
- **Risk of overextension:** low / medium / high  
- **Usage mode:** illustrative / framing only / core model  

**Entries**

- *(empty until used)*

---

## IV. LOCAL MEMORY / EXECUTION LOG

*(WORK-local operating memory: decisions, experiments, actions, intermediate syntheses, and implementation notes.)*

### Foresight threads

- _TBD_

### Recent decisions

- _TBD_

### Recent experiments

- _TBD_

### Follow-up items

- _TBD_

---

## V. PROMOTION / RETIREMENT RECORD

*(Sparse changelog — pointers and reasons. Detailed rows live in II-A / III-A / IV as appropriate.)*

### Promoted items

- _TBD_

### Retired items

- _TBD_

### Calibration notes

- _TBD_

---

## VI. GOVERNANCE NOTES

### Write rules

- _TBD_

### Review cadence

- _TBD_

### Promotion conditions

- _TBD_

### Retirement conditions

- _TBD_

---

## VII. RISK MITIGATION (copy from [work-template README](README.md#risk-mitigation-checklist-tier-1))

### Success criteria

| Metric | Target | How to measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

### Sustainment

| Task | Cadence | What to check |
|------|---------|---------------|
| _TBD_ | _TBD_ | _TBD_ |

### Deprecation path

1. _TBD_ — what to stop
2. _TBD_ — how to clear pending work
3. _TBD_ — where to archive
4. _TBD_ — what to remove

### Scope creep guardrail

> _TBD_ — name the boundary and what requires a new plan or ADR to cross.
