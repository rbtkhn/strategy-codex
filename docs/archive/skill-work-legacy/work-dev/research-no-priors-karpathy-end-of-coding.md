## Summary

Karpathy describes a sharp **workflow shift** (post–late 2024): mostly **delegating** to coding agents (“barely typing”), **parallel macro-actions** across repos, **token throughput** as the new scarce resource (analogy to GPU utilization), and **persistent “claw”**-style loops with richer memory than default chat compaction. He praises **OpenClaw** (personality / **self** doc, memory, **WhatsApp** portal) and gives a **home-automation** example (“Dobby”). **Auto-research** = remove the human from the inner loop: overnight hyperparameter / training improvements on his small-model harness; generalizes to “research org as **program.md**,” meta-optimization over instructions, and **untrusted worker swarms** with cheap verification (SETI@home / folding analogies). Caveats: **verifiable metrics** fit automation; **“jagged”** capability (e.g. jokes outside RL) limits blind end-to-end trust. **micro-GPT** (~200 lines) as minimal LLM training core; education shifts toward **agents explaining to humans** and **markdown-for-agents** docs.

## work-dev takeaways (Grace-Mar ⟷ OpenClaw)

| Theme in discourse | work-dev use |
|--------------------|--------------|
| **Claws / persistent loops** | Aligns with **long-horizon agent OS** narrative — not “one chat session.” Maps to **session continuity as contract** ([session-continuity-contract.md](session-continuity-contract.md)) and **visible state** (pending vs merged) in [safety-story-ux.md](safety-story-ux.md). OpenClaw-specific praise is **temperature**, not a spec — see [integration-status.md](integration-status.md). |
| **OpenClaw (Peter, self/identity doc, memory, WhatsApp)** | Reinforces **wiring + identity + memory surface** as product class; Grace-Mar’s differentiator remains **Record → export** + **companion gate** ([README.md](README.md) invariant). Third-party persona docs ≠ merge into SELF without pipeline. |
| **Macro-actions / parallel agents** | **Handback** and **stage-only** automation must stay **inspectable** — swarm metaphors do not justify skipping receipts or RECURSION-GATE structure. |
| **Token throughput / subscription anxiety** | [economic-benchmarks.md](economic-benchmarks.md) — keep **cost and demand** labels honest; operator burn is real but not a Voice/Record claim. |
| **Auto-research / recursive optimization** | **Contrast:** their loops optimize **verifiable** training metrics. Grace-Mar’s **gated pipeline** optimizes **human-approved** identity truth — different object, same **“don’t silently ship”** fear class as [safety-story-ux.md](safety-story-ux.md). |
| **program.md / org as markdown** | Analogy to **skills, manifests, INTENT** — structured operator instructions; still **not** a substitute for companion approval on Record changes. |
| **Untrusted swarm + verify** | Loose parallel to **merge receipts**, **pipeline events**, **CI** — **cheap verification** of what landed in git vs **expensive search** in agent space. |
| **Jaggedness (RL on rails vs off)** | Supports [agent-reliability-playbook.md](agent-reliability-playbook.md): **tail scenarios**, don’t treat chat fluency as audit. |
| **Dobby / home APIs** | Illustrates **tool breadth** demand for personal agents — **provenance** and **permission boundaries** for OpenClaw ↔ repo integration stay in [openclaw-integration.md](../../openclaw-integration.md). |
| **micro-GPT / education via agents** | **Pedagogy** moves toward agent-mediated explanation; Grace-Mar **Voice** still bounded by **knowledge boundary** and Lexile — external “teach the codebase” patterns don’t change Record law. |

## Guardrail

**Opinion and practitioner color, not requirements.** If Karpathy or the host says “everyone will X,” **ship truth** stays [integration-status.md](integration-status.md) and [known-gaps.md](known-gaps.md). Use this note to **name** buyer/operator anxiety and **align vocabulary** — not to slip undocumented features into the integration story.
