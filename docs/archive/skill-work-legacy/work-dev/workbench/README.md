# Workbench Harness (work-dev)

**Status:** WORK-only. **Markdown-first**, repo-native. **Not** a merge path, **not** Record, **not** EVIDENCE truth.

## What it is

The **Workbench Harness** is a narrow **artifact execution and inspection** layer for **generated** code, UI, HTML/React/SVG, CLI tools, scripts, and strategy-notebook views. It makes a **repeatable loop** legible: generate â†’ run â†’ inspect â†’ revise â†’ **workbench receipt** â†’ operator review.

Workbench answers: *â€œDid this artifact run, render, and behave as intended in this environment?â€* It does **not** answer *â€œIs this claim about the world true?â€*

Use the [../interface-runtime/artifacts/README.md](../../../../runtime/artifacts/README.md) family when you need to define **what kind of generated operator-facing artifact** you are making and what authority it does or does not have. Workbench remains the **inspection layer** for those artifacts, not a replacement doctrine for them.

## What it is not

- **Not** the [Record](../../../../AGENTS.md) or a path into it. Workbench receipts have **`recordAuthority: "none"`** and **`gateEffect: "none"`** unless you separately stage work through [recursion-gate.md](../../../../archive/grace-mar-instance/recursion-gate.md) using existing workflows.
- **Not** [action receipts](../../../action-receipts.md) (audit stubs for meaningful system actions like proposals or merges).
- **Not** merge or pipeline receipts ([harness-inventory](../../../harness-inventory.md) / `merge-receipts.jsonl` â€” proof of **approved** pipeline/gate processing).
- **Not** continuity / handback receipts (OpenClaw preflight, session continuity).
- **Not** a replacement for [harness replay](../../../harness-replay.md) (event/candidate correlation across `pipeline-events.jsonl`, gate blocks, etc.).
- **Not** a replacement for [observability](../../../observability.md) aggregates.

## How it fits (one sentence each)

| Surface | Role |
|--------|------|
| [Action receipts](../../../action-receipts.md) | Makes **system actions** (e.g. change proposals) inspectable; not the Record, not a second merge path. |
| [Observability](../../../observability.md) | Aggregates over proposals, validators, operational counts. |
| [Harness replay](../../../harness-replay.md) | Replays **gate/candidate** and pipeline **events**; does not substitute for â€œdid the UI work?â€ |
| [Verification runs](../verification-runs/README.md) | Dated **manual or script** verification for [claimâ€“proof](../claim-proof-standard.md) on capabilities. |
| **Workbench** | **Artifact** run/inspect/revise with a **workbench receipt**; proves **build/runtime behavior** under stated conditions, not world truth. |

Runtime vs Record: treat Workbench as **work-dev / runtime lab** work. Nothing here auto-writes SELF, EVIDENCE, or the gate.

## When to use it

- Generated dashboards, visualizers, or storybook-style views.
- HTML/React/SVG, CLI tools, or scripts the agent (or you) just produced.
- Strategy-notebook or similar **WORK** UIs you need to **see** before trusting.

## Core loop

1. **Generate** â€” code or assets land under repo paths (or a bounded scratch path).
2. **Run** â€” `launchCommand` (and `commandsRun` as needed).
3. **Inspect** â€” see [VISUAL-INSPECTION-PROTOCOL.md](VISUAL-INSPECTION-PROTOCOL.md) for visuals; adapt for headless CLIs.
4. **Revise** â€” record what changed; summarize in the receipt.
5. **Receipt** â€” write a [WORKBENCH-RECEIPT-SPEC](WORKBENCH-RECEIPT-SPEC.md) JSON object; store under [default output path](#where-to-store-receipts) or a team convention.
6. **Operator review** â€” human decides what ships, what gets a gate candidate, or what to discard.

## Doctrine (non-negotiable)

- **`recordAuthority`:** `none` for workbench receipts â€” they do not assert Record or EVIDENCE authority.
- **`gateEffect`:** `none` â€” a workbench receipt does not approve, merge, or stage candidates. Staging still uses the normal gate pipeline if you choose to.
- **Truth scope:** Screenshots, logs, and tests in a receipt show **artifact behavior** under the described setup; they do not prove **external** facts. Same spirit as [action-receipts.md](../../../action-receipts.md): *inspectable*, not *oracular*.

## Where to store receipts

- **Default suggested path for real runs:** [runtime/artifacts/work-dev/workbench-receipts/](../../../../runtime/artifacts/work-dev/workbench-receipts/README.md) (create JSON files there; add to `.gitignore` locally if some runs must not be committed).
- **Examples and fixtures:** [examples/](examples/) under this folder.

v1 does **not** require placing receipts under `` canonical files.

## Script support

- **`scripts/work_dev/new_workbench_receipt.py`** â€” create a new receipt JSON (defaults: `receiptKind` `workbench`, `status` `draft`, `recordAuthority` / `gateEffect` `none`; default file under `runtime/artifacts/work-dev/workbench-receipts/`).
- **`scripts/work_dev/validate_workbench_receipt.py`** â€” validate one receipt; exits non-zero on errors.
- **`scripts/work_dev/preflight_workbench.py`** â€” read-only **pilot chain** check: docs, visualizer files, static HTML smoke, committed fixture, example `workbench` receipts, and (by default) `generate_strategy_notebook_visualizer_fixture.py --check` (`--skip-smoke` / `--skip-freshness` to omit steps). See [PREFLIGHT.md](PREFLIGHT.md).

Details and copy-paste examples: [SCRIPT-USAGE.md](SCRIPT-USAGE.md). Spec field list: [WORKBENCH-RECEIPT-SPEC.md](WORKBENCH-RECEIPT-SPEC.md).

## Preflight (operator, not CI)

Before a demo or commit that touches the strategy visualizer or Workbench examples, run the preflight in [PREFLIGHT.md](PREFLIGHT.md) from the repo root. It does not modify the Record, does not touch ``, and does not stage the gate. It is **not** a claim that the UI is strategically correctâ€”only that artifacts and **workbench** boundaries are structurally in range.

## Non-goals (explicit)

- Does **not** by itself satisfy [claim-proof-standard.md](../claim-proof-standard.md) for an **implemented** capability row â€” use tests, [verification-runs](../verification-runs/README.md), or demos when elevating that claim. Workbench can still be cited as *supporting* â€œwe ran it and saw X.â€
- Does **not** replace harness replay, observability, or gate hygiene.

## Pilot artifacts

- **Strategy notebook (static):** [demo-runs/workbench-visualizer/README.md](../../../../README.md) â€” fixture + HTML over `http.server`; `recordAuthority: none` / `gateEffect: none`; example receipt: [examples/strategy-notebook-visualizer-workbench-receipt.example.json](examples/strategy-notebook-visualizer-workbench-receipt.example.json). Optional screenshot staging: [runtime/artifacts/work-dev/workbench-screenshots/](../../../../runtime/artifacts/work-dev/workbench-screenshots/README.md).

## Specs and protocols

| Doc | Role |
|-----|------|
| [WORKBENCH-RECEIPT-SPEC.md](WORKBENCH-RECEIPT-SPEC.md) | JSON field definitions (`receiptKind: "workbench"`, camelCase). |
| [SCRIPT-USAGE.md](SCRIPT-USAGE.md) | `new_workbench_receipt.py` and `validate_workbench_receipt.py` (examples, non-staging). |
| [VISUAL-INSPECTION-PROTOCOL.md](VISUAL-INSPECTION-PROTOCOL.md) | Required steps for **visual** artifacts. |
| [CANDIDATE-COMPARISON-PROTOCOL.md](CANDIDATE-COMPARISON-PROTOCOL.md) | Compare multiple generated **candidates** (A/B) before choosing a path. |
| [../interface-runtime/artifacts/README.md](../../../../runtime/artifacts/README.md) | Defines interface artifacts as a derived class of operator-facing views and prototypes; Workbench then runs and inspects them. |
