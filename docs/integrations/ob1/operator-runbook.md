# OB1 Bridge — Operator Runbook

**Prerequisite:** An OB1 Supabase instance must be deployed before any of these workflows are usable. See [README.md](README.md) § Implementation triggers.

All workflows are **manual and operator-initiated**. No background process, no webhook, no scheduled job.

---

## Phase 1: Export (companion-self → OB1)

### When to export

- After a batch of gate merges (Record has grown meaningfully)
- When setting up a new OB1 instance for the first time
- When refreshing an OB1 deployment after extended companion-self work

### Workflow

1. **Review what will export.** Run the export script with `--dry-run` first:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/export_open_brain_bundle.py -u <user-id> --dry-run
   ```
   Verify: governed surfaces (pending gate, session-log) are excluded. Only approved Record content appears.

2. **Run the export.** Remove `--dry-run`:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/export_open_brain_bundle.py -u <user-id> -o ob1-export/
   ```
   Output: `ob1-export/` directory with `manifest.json`, content files, and `.meta.json` sidecars.

3. **Verify determinism.** Run the export again. The manifest and content fingerprints should match (content-addressed, not timestamp-dependent).

4. **Ingest into OB1.** Use OB1's recipe system or manual import path. The export bundle is self-describing (manifest lists files, schemas, and provenance).

5. **Do not commit the export bundle.** It is a transient artifact. The source of truth remains the companion-self repo files.

### What is excluded by default

| Surface | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| `recursion-gate.md` (pending candidates) | Unapproved content is not Record |
| `session-log.md` | Operational log, not identity |
| `self-memory.md` | Ephemeral continuity, not durable knowledge |
| `archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/prompt.py` | Derivative of SELF; not a primary source |
| `.git/`, `scripts/`, `tests/` | Infrastructure, not Record |

Override with `--include <surface>` if specific surfaces are needed for a use case.

---

## Phase 2: Import-staging (OB1 → companion-self)

### When to import

- When OB1 has accumulated thoughts from AI interactions that may contain identity-relevant material
- When a companion session happened through an OB1-connected client and produced signals not captured in companion-self
- **Not** as a routine sync — only when there is a reason to believe OB1 holds uncaptured material

### Workflow

1. **Export from OB1.** Use OB1's backup or export tooling to produce a local JSON file of thoughts. This step is OB1-side; no companion-self script is involved.

2. **Review the raw export.** Inspect the JSON to understand volume and content quality before running the import script.

3. **Run the import-staging script with `--dry-run`:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/import_ob1_to_proposals.py --input ob1-thoughts.json --dry-run
   ```
   Verify: low-grounded thoughts are filtered. Duplicates (by OB1 id + fingerprint) are skipped. Trust tiers are assigned. Target surfaces are reasonable.

4. **Run the import-staging script:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/import_ob1_to_proposals.py --input ob1-thoughts.json
   ```
   Output: proposal objects staged for review.

5. **Review proposals through the existing pipeline.** The companion reviews and approves/rejects each proposal through RECURSION-GATE, the same as any other candidate.

6. **Merge approved proposals:**
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/process_approved_candidates.py --apply
   ```

### What the import script never does

- Write to `self.md`, `self-archive.md`, or `archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/prompt.py`
- Auto-approve proposals
- Create a sync loop or schedule
- Skip grounding filters or trust-tier assignment
- Import without deduplication

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| Export produces different fingerprints on repeated runs | Non-deterministic content (timestamps in output?) | Check export script for time-dependent fields |
| Import stages duplicates | Dedup key mismatch (OB1 id changed?) | Verify OB1 thought IDs are stable across exports |
| Proposals reference unknown IX-A/B/C targets | Mapping rules need updating for new Record structure | Review [mapping.md](mapping.md) target surface rules |
| OB1 ingest rejects export bundle | OB1 schema version mismatch | Pin OB1 version; check recipe compatibility |

---

## Guardrails

- **Always dry-run first.** Both export and import scripts support `--dry-run`.
- **Never bypass the gate.** OB1 content enters through RECURSION-GATE like everything else.
- **No secrets in the repo.** Supabase credentials, API keys, and connection strings stay in the operator's local environment, never committed. Do not store credentials on shared machines or pass them through CI pipelines. Rotate credentials if the operator's machine is compromised.
- **No unattended execution.** Do not cron, schedule, or automate these scripts. Do not wrap them in CI workflows, GitHub Actions, or any scheduled runner. Every invocation is a conscious operator decision.
- **No bulk-approve.** The import script does not offer `--approve-all`. Each proposal is reviewed and approved individually through the existing RECURSION-GATE pipeline.
- **Export excludes are safety defaults.** If you override with `--include`, you are explicitly expanding the data boundary. Review the full export with `--dry-run` after any `--include` override. Embedding inversion attacks can theoretically reconstruct private content from vector representations — treat any OB1 cloud deployment as a data exposure surface.

## Import volume controls

| Control | Default | Purpose |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `--max-proposals N` | 20 | Caps proposals staged per import run; excess deferred by grounding score |
| Backlog warning | 30 pending | Import script warns if OB1-sourced pending proposals exceed threshold |
| Review time target | < 5 min / 10 proposals | Pilot success criteria; sustained overrun means filters are too permissive |

If the queue grows faster than review clears it, reduce import frequency — do not increase batch size.

---

## Sustainment (long-term maintenance)

The bridge degrades silently without ongoing investment. These are not one-time tasks.

| Task | Cadence | What to check |
|------|---------|---------------|
| **Re-embedding consistency** | After any embedding model change in OB1 | Re-export and re-ingest the full bundle; old embeddings and new embeddings in the same index produce inconsistent retrieval |
| **OB1 version check** | Before upgrading OB1 Supabase instance | Run export + import test suite against the new version; check for schema field renames or removals |
| **Retrieval quality spot-check** | Quarterly or after Record doubles in size | Run 10 standard test queries against OB1; compare precision to the chunking spike baseline. If precision drops > 20%, re-evaluate chunk strategy |
| **Provenance audit** | After 50 OB1-sourced merges or quarterly | What fraction of recent Record additions came through the bridge? If > 30%, review quality bar |
| **Filter calibration** | After 20 rejected proposals with logged reasons | Are rejections catching real issues or rejecting good content? Adjust grounding thresholds |

---

## Deprecation and retirement

If OB1 evolves unfavorably (breaking schema changes, project abandonment, trust model mismatch), the bridge can be retired without Record impact:

1. **Stop importing.** No new proposals from OB1. Pending OB1-sourced proposals in the gate can be reviewed and cleared normally.
2. **Stop exporting.** The Record continues in companion-self unaffected. OB1 retains its last export but receives no updates.
3. **Archive the bridge docs.** Move `docs/platform/integrations/ob1/` to `docs/platform/integrations/ob1-archived/` with a README note explaining when and why.
4. **Remove scripts.** Delete export/import scripts from companion-self. No Record data is lost — the bridge only read from and staged to the existing pipeline.

The Record's integrity is never dependent on OB1. Retirement is a cleanup task, not a migration.
