# OB1 Bridge — Trust Tiers

Classifies every object that crosses the bridge by the reliability of its content. Trust tiers determine **handling rules** — what review is required, what surfaces are eligible, and what can be rejected automatically.

**Related:** [mapping.md](mapping.md) (field definitions), [architecture.md](architecture.md) (safety model).

## Tier definitions

| Tier | Label | Definition | Examples |
|------|-------|------------|----------|
| **A** | Raw evidence | Content that directly reflects companion actions, statements, or artifacts with minimal interpretation. High confidence that it represents ground truth. | EVIDENCE entries (ACT, READ, WRITE, CREATE, MEDIA), companion-written text, artifact files, approved SELF content |
| **B** | Structured summary | Content derived from raw evidence through aggregation, formatting, or light synthesis. The underlying facts are grounded but the presentation involves editorial choices. | Structured IX-A/B/C entries derived from multiple signals, self-memory continuity notes, skill assessments built from evidence |
| **C** | Synthesized output | Content produced by an AI agent, model, or automated process. May contain useful signals but is not grounded in direct companion input. Mixed trust — requires filtering. | OB1 thoughts from agent sessions, model-generated summaries, auto-tagged metadata, speculative inferences |

## Handling rules by tier

### Tier A — Raw evidence

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Export to OB1** | Eligible by default. These are the highest-value chunks for OB1 retrieval. |
| **Import from OB1** | If OB1 holds Tier A content that originated from companion-self, it is likely a re-import. Dedup by fingerprint. If OB1 holds original Tier A content (e.g. companion typed directly into an OB1 client), treat as a new evidence candidate — stage to gate. |
| **Auto-reject** | Never. Tier A content always receives human review. |
| **Target surfaces** | `IX-A`, `IX-B`, `IX-C`, `archive/placeholders/evidence`. All Record surfaces are eligible. |
| **Review priority** | High. Tier A proposals should surface at the top of review queues. |

### Tier B — Structured summary

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Export to OB1** | Eligible but excluded by default (memory, work surfaces). Opt in with `--include memory` or `--include work`. |
| **Import from OB1** | Stage to gate with a note that content is derived, not raw. Reviewer should verify the underlying evidence exists. |
| **Auto-reject** | No, but flag if no grounding evidence is cited. |
| **Target surfaces** | `IX-A`, `IX-B`, `IX-C`, `memory`. Record surfaces require stronger justification than Tier A. `memory` is the safe default. |
| **Review priority** | Medium. Review after all Tier A proposals. |

### Tier C — Synthesized output

| Rule | Detail |
|------|--------|
| **Export to OB1** | Not exported by default. Work-territory content is operator-scoped and mixed-trust. |
| **Import from OB1** | Stage only if grounding score passes threshold. Most Tier C thoughts should be filtered before staging. |
| **Auto-reject** | Yes, if grounding score is below threshold. Threshold is configurable; default is conservative (reject unless clearly grounded). |
| **Target surfaces** | `memory` (ephemeral pointer) or `reject`. Tier C content does not enter Record surfaces without explicit operator override. |
| **Review priority** | Low. Review only after Tier A and B proposals are cleared. |

## Grounding score

The grounding score quantifies how well an OB1 thought connects to verifiable companion input. It is computed by the `score_grounding()` filter function.

| Score range | Interpretation | Default handling |
|-------------|---------------|------------------|
| 0.0 – 0.3 | Low grounding — likely model-generated, speculative, or generic | Auto-reject (Tier C) or flag for review (Tier B) |
| 0.3 – 0.6 | Partial grounding — some companion signal but mixed with inference | Stage with flag; reviewer decides |
| 0.6 – 1.0 | Strong grounding — clear companion input, specific details, verifiable | Stage normally |

### Grounding signals (inputs to score)

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Companion-attributed text | High | The thought quotes or paraphrases something the companion said |
| Specific names, dates, or events | High | Concrete details that can be cross-referenced with EVIDENCE |
| First-person companion voice | Medium | Written from the companion's perspective, not an observer's |
| Temporal specificity | Medium | References a specific time, session, or activity |
| Generic or abstract language | Negative | Vague statements that could apply to anyone |
| Model hedging language | Negative | "It seems like," "perhaps," "based on our conversation" without specifics |
| Contradiction with existing Record | Flag | Does not reduce score but flags for explicit review |

## Tier escalation and override

- **Tier can only be upgraded by the operator** during review. The import script assigns the initial tier; the reviewer may override upward (e.g. Tier C → Tier B if they recognize grounded content the filter missed).
- **Tier cannot be auto-upgraded.** No script or automated process may reclassify a thought to a higher tier without human review.
- **Override is logged.** If the operator overrides a tier assignment, the proposal object records `{ original_tier, override_tier, override_reason }`.

---

## Relationship to existing pipeline

Trust tiers are a **bridge-specific** classification. They do not replace or modify the existing RECURSION-GATE candidate model. The relationship:

| Bridge concept | Pipeline equivalent |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Tier A proposal | High-confidence candidate (knowledge, personality, archive/placeholders/evidence) |
| Tier B proposal | Candidate that may need additional evidence before merge |
| Tier C proposal (staged) | Low-confidence candidate; reviewer may reject or defer |
| Auto-rejected Tier C | Never becomes a candidate; filtered before gate |

The gate's `status: pending` / `approved` / `rejected` flow is unchanged. Trust tiers add pre-gate filtering and review prioritization, not a parallel governance track.

## Governance risks and mitigations

### Proposal fatigue / review backlog

If OB1 generates high volumes of thoughts (common with active MCP usage), the importer can flood the review queue. Even with strong grounding filters, operators may experience decision paralysis or eventually rubber-stamp approvals.

**Mitigations:**
- **Import batch cap:** The import script should accept `--max-proposals N` (default: 20). If more thoughts pass filters, stage the top N by grounding score and report how many were deferred. The operator runs again for the next batch.
- **Review time budget:** Pilot success criteria (see [README.md](README.md)) include a target of < 5 minutes per 10 proposals. If review consistently exceeds this, filters are too permissive or the import cadence is too frequent.
- **Backlog pressure metric:** If pending OB1-sourced proposals exceed 30, the import script should warn before staging more. Clear the queue before importing again.

### Gradual contamination creep

Well-written but subtly flawed OB1-sourced proposals (synthesized summaries, mild hallucinations, agent-flavored interpretations) can influence the human reviewer over time, diluting the grounded Record without a clear breach event.

**Mitigations:**
- **Provenance audit:** Every merged candidate from OB1 carries `channel_key: operator:ob1-import` in the gate. Periodically (quarterly or after 50 OB1-sourced merges, whichever is first), run a provenance audit: what fraction of recent Record additions came through the bridge? If > 30%, review whether those entries meet the same quality bar as companion-reported content.
- **Contamination flag in trust-tier override:** When an operator upgrades a Tier C proposal to Tier B or higher, the override log (`original_tier`, `override_tier`, `override_reason`) creates an audit trail. A pattern of frequent upgrades from C → A or C → B is a signal that either the filter is miscalibrated or the reviewer is being too generous.

### False sense of safety

The heavy documentation and "never direct writes" language create strong guardrails on paper, but a tired or time-pressed operator might bypass the full review. The plan doesn't deeply address enforcement beyond manual process.

**Mitigations:**
- **`human_action_required: true`** is structural — the merge script (`process_approved_candidates.py`) requires per-candidate approval, not bulk-approve. This is already enforced in the existing pipeline.
- **No `--approve-all` flag.** The import script must not offer batch approval. Each proposal is approved individually through the existing gate flow.
- **Review-session logging:** When the operator reviews OB1 proposals, the session log should record review duration and accept/reject counts. If review speed exceeds 1 proposal per 15 seconds, flag that in the next coffee warmup as a potential rubber-stamping signal.

### Heuristic limits

Grounding filters and trust tiers are rule-based. They help but will miss nuanced cases — subtle synthesis that reads as grounded, context-dependent value that rules cannot detect, or evolving personal ontology that outdates the mapping rules.

**Mitigation:** The structural backstop is `human_action_required: true` on every proposal. Rules are pre-filters that reduce volume; the human reviewer is the final authority. When the reviewer rejects a proposal that scored well on grounding, log the reason — these rejections are the training data for improving filters over time.
