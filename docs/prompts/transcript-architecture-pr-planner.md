# The Comprehension Map (Grace-Mar)

**Easy title to remember:** **The Comprehension Map** — *transcript in → repo-fit verdict + PR sequence out* (not a summary).

| | |
|---|---|
| **Machine name** | `transcript-architecture-pr-planner` |
| **File** | `docs/prompts/transcript-architecture-pr-planner.md` |

**Use when:** You have an external transcript (or long-form argument) and want a governance-first, repo-specific PR plan—not a summary.

**Attach:** The transcript (or paste below this block). Replace any thesis bullets with the transcript’s actual claims if needed.

### How to deploy (run it)

1. **Open** this file in Cursor (or `@`-mention `docs/prompts/transcript-architecture-pr-planner.md` in chat).
2. **Prefix** the turn with **`PLAN`** if you want analysis only (no file edits / no git)—see [operator-agent-lanes.md](../operator-agent-lanes.md). Use **`EXECUTE`** only when you are asking the agent to implement something the map already approved.
3. **Paste or attach** the full transcript (or link + paste key sections). Say one line: e.g. *“Run The Comprehension Map on the attached transcript.”*
4. **Read** sections A–H in the reply; pick PRs or file a plan doc—**no** automatic merge into Record or gate.

**One-line invoke:** `PLAN — @transcript-architecture-pr-planner.md + [attach transcript] — run The Comprehension Map.`

You are inside a local clone of the Grace-Mar repository.

Act as a senior architecture reviewer and implementation planner.
Your job is to extract the most actionable repo-specific insights from the attached transcript and convert them into a disciplined PR sequence for Grace-Mar.

You are not here to summarize the transcript.
You are here to decide what Grace-Mar should build, what it should ignore, and how to implement the best ideas in a governance-first way.

Core repo assumptions you must respect:

- Grace-Mar is governance-first, not generation-first.
- Runtime outputs and canonical Record are intentionally separated.
- Durable changes should be staged/reviewed rather than auto-merged.
- The system values evidence, boundaries, auditability, workflow lanes, and operator trust.
- Recommendations must fit an additive, composable repo evolution path rather than a sweeping rewrite.

Transcript thesis to pressure-test against Grace-Mar:

The transcript argues that in the AI era, generation is cheap, comprehension is scarce, and value must be demonstrated through explanation, visible proof-of-work, tradeoff awareness, and artifacts that travel with the work. It emphasizes comprehension over generation, explanation as a first-class artifact, proof attached to outputs, visible human judgment, working in the open, and preserving human understanding rather than becoming a “slop factory.” *(Adjust this paragraph to match the attached transcript if it differs.)*

Your framing question:

“How can Grace-Mar better preserve and operationalize comprehension—not just generation—inside a gated cognitive architecture?”

What to do before answering:

1. Inspect the repository structure and identify the real touchpoints where transcript ideas could fit.
2. Ground every recommendation in existing repo patterns where possible.
3. Prefer the smallest viable architecture change that yields durable value.
4. Translate transcript language into Grace-Mar language rather than copying its terminology.
5. Distinguish clearly between:
   - runtime
   - review/gate
   - canonical Record
   - notebook/workflow surfaces
   - archive/placeholders/evidence/provenance surfaces
   - observability/audit surfaces

Hard constraints:

- Do not propose Grace-Mar become a social network, public portfolio site, or résumé platform.
- Do not recommend public-by-default workflows unless carefully adapted.
- Do not reward output quantity for its own sake.
- Do not introduce “explanation” in a way that becomes mandatory busywork everywhere.
- Do not collapse governance boundaries in the name of speed.
- Do not give generic advice detached from files, scripts, docs, or repo surfaces.

Required output format:

## A. Executive verdict

Give:

- 3 strongest insights Grace-Mar should absorb
- 3 transcript ideas that are overrated or non-fitting
- 1 sentence on the most important implementation direction

## B. Repo-fit insight map

For each major transcript principle, provide:

- principle
- Grace-Mar fit: strong / partial / weak
- translation into repo language
- likely repo touchpoints
- why it matters here
- risk if implemented badly

Cover at minimum:

- comprehension over generation
- explanation as artifact
- proof attached to work
- blast-radius awareness
- visible human override / judgment
- transaction history / micro-proof
- working in the open

## C. Concrete opportunities

List 10–12 repo-specific opportunities.

For each:

- title
- what problem it solves
- exact place it belongs
- likely files/dirs touched
- small/medium/large
- leverage rating
- why it is specifically good for Grace-Mar

Bias toward ideas such as:

- explanation sidecars attached to outputs
- “why this / why not that” capture
- tradeoff and blast-radius fields
- operator override markers
- review/gate enrichment
- proof-of-comprehension templates
- notebook writing aids
- observability for comprehension vs output velocity
- audit-friendly schemas
- structured reflection only where leverage is high

## D. Best PR sequence

Propose the best 6 PRs in order.

For each PR include:

- PR title
- purpose
- why this PR should come at this point in sequence
- capability added
- likely files touched
- acceptance criteria
- anti-goals
- follow-on PRs it unlocks

These PRs should feel like something a repo owner could hand directly to Claude Code.

## E. Best first PR in full detail

Pick the single best first PR and expand it into a build-ready implementation brief with:

- goal
- exact design
- where it fits architecturally
- file-by-file plan
- schema/template details if relevant
- sample acceptance tests
- migration or rollout notes
- why it is better than the next-best candidate

## F. Design cautions

List the most important tensions:

- explanation vs burden
- visibility vs noise
- governance vs speed
- auditability vs friction
- structured capture vs natural writing
- private cognition vs public proof

For each:

- preferred balance for Grace-Mar
- one design rule

## G. Reject list

List ideas from the transcript that Grace-Mar should reject outright or only adapt very cautiously.
Be explicit.

## H. Final recommendation

End with:

- top 3 actions to do now
- top 3 to defer
- one sentence completing:
  “If Grace-Mar learns only one lesson from this transcript, it should be _____.”

Style requirements:

- Be highly specific.
- Be architectural, not motivational.
- Be concrete enough that implementation could begin immediately.
- Use repo-aware language.
- Favor additive design.
- Avoid hand-wavy abstractions.
- Prefer recommendations that strengthen trust, explainability, and boundary integrity.

Important:

Assume the reader is the repo owner.
They want actionable insight, not inspiration.
Your output should help decide what to implement next.
