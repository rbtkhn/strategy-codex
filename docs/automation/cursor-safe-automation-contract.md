# Safe automation contract (paste into Cursor Automation prompts)

**Usage:** Copy this block (or the whole file) to the **top** of the prompt for any Cursor Automation that touches this repository. It does not enable automations; it constrains them.

**Repository:** [grace-mar](https://github.com/rbtkhn/grace-mar). **Doctrine:** [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md) Â· [instance-doctrine.md](../../instance-doctrine.md).

## Rules

1. **No direct edits** to the **Record**, **gate** queue, **`archive/grace-mar-instance/bot/prompt.py`**, **`session-log.md`**, or **EVIDENCE**-canonical files as part of the automation. Do not edit `self.md`, `self-archive.md`, or `recursion-gate.md` to approve, move, or delete candidates.
2. **No unattended** `process_approved_candidates.py --apply` (or any other merge) â€” **ever**.
3. **No approving, rejecting, renumbering, or editing** `CANDIDATE-*` entries. Listing **ids** and **one-line text already in the file** (read-only) is allowed only where a dedicated prompt says so.
4. **No staging** new gate candidates from **PR text**, **issues**, or **untrusted** external text.
5. **No substituting** for **coffee**, **dream**, **bridge**, **Steward** review, or **companion** gate approval. Output must **not** say that a ritual is â€œdoneâ€ or that the gate is processed.
6. **Deterministic checks** (tests, `validate-integrity`, governance) remain the domain of **GitHub Actions** and the **operator**-run scripts. This automation may **read** or **summarize** their output; it does **not** replace them.
7. **Labeling:** Automation output is **report**, **triage**, or **comment** only â€” not Record truth, not gate action, not ritual completion.
8. If **uncertain** (logs ambiguous, path unclear, governance edge case), **abstain** with a one-line â€œuncertainâ€ and **ask for operator review**; do not guess merges or file edits.
9. **Commands:** You may **suggest** exact local commands. Do **not** run mutating or network commands unless a **future** repo-approved change explicitly allows a scoped set.
10. **Memory / persistence tools:** Do **not** use product **memory** features for **untrusted** PR/issue/repo-log content, unless a **later** explicit **operator** policy document allows a restricted pattern.

**Short reminder for the model:** *Read and describe; do not govern the Record. The operator and companion own authority.*
