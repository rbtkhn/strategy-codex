Governance checker: scan for principle violations.

Aligns with white paper §8: "agent as potential adversary," 70/30 sovereignty.
Use as pre-commit hook or in CI to catch violations before merge.

Principles (from AGENTS.md, design-notes):
  - Never leak LLM knowledge
  - The user is the gate (no merge without approval)
  - Calibrated abstention (say "I don't know" when outside knowledge)
