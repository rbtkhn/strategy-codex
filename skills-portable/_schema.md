# Portable skill schema (strategy-codex)

## Folder

```text
skills-portable/<skill-name>/
  SKILL.md              # required
  examples/             # optional — few-shots, long samples
  HOSTS.md              # optional — install notes per vendor
```

## Frontmatter (portable `SKILL.md`)

| Key | Required | Notes |
|-----|----------|--------|
| `name` | yes | Stable id; folder name should match. |
| `description` | yes | **Single line.** Triggers, in/out contract, output shape hints (agent routing). |
| `portable` | yes | `true` — marks inclusion in sync manifest. |
| `version` | yes | Semver string for export/changelog. |
| `tags` | no | e.g. `[operator, work-politics]` for mirrors. |
| `requires` | no | Skill dependencies, e.g. `[handoff-check]`. Validator checks that listed skills exist under `.cursor/skills/`. |

## Body rules (portable core)

- Prefer **placeholders** for repo roots and script names in the main methodology.
- Put **host-specific paths** only in `.cursor/skills/.../CURSOR_APPENDIX.md`, not in the portable core.
- **Forbidden substrings** in core (enforced by `sync_portable_skills.py --verify` when configured): instance user dirs, merge scripts — keep those in the appendix.
- Prefer host-equivalent placeholders such as `<operator-profile>`, `<approval-process>`, or `<calendar-notebook>` when the portable methodology would otherwise assume repo-specific files.
- Portable cores may describe **proposal** or **stage-only** outputs, but should not imply direct merge authority on Record-bearing surfaces.

## Optional: Agent behavior norms (social contract)

Agent-facing skills may include a short subsection:

**`## Agent behavior norms`** (or `## Collaboration norms`)

Suggested bullets (adapt per skill):

- **Human authority** — Assist; do not treat automation as overriding user or companion intent on gated surfaces.
- **Brevity** — Default to concise outputs unless the operator asks for depth.
- **No silent overwrite** — Do not replace user- or companion-owned text without explicit consent.
- **Abstention** — When evidence is missing or upstream docs already state a fact, say so; avoid false gaps.
- **Leakage** — Do not inject private instance or Record details into outbound copy unless requested.

Norms belong in the **portable core** when they are **host-agnostic**. Instance merge policy and paths stay in **`CURSOR_APPENDIX.md`**.

Authoring guide: [docs/skills/skill-authoring-norms.md](../docs/skills/skill-authoring-norms.md).

## Generated `.cursor/skills/.../SKILL.md`

- Appends appendix under heading `## Cursor / strategy-codex instance`.
- Adds `portable_source` and `synced_by` to frontmatter for audit.

## Versioning

Bump `version` in portable `SKILL.md` when methodology meaningfully changes; re-run sync before commit.

## Portable core vs host glue (habit)

When adding or extending skills, label the layer explicitly:

| Layer | What it is | Examples |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **Portable core** | Reusable methodology; works across hosts after sync | `skills-portable/<name>/SKILL.md` body, placeholders, `manifest.yaml` entries |
| **Host glue** | Editor- or instance-specific wiring | `.cursor/skills/.../CURSOR_APPENDIX.md`, Cursor-only paths, merge scripts named in appendix only |

This mirrors the open-connector vs proprietary-surface pattern: keep **protocol** (portable + validator) in the portable tree; keep **single-host UX** in generated host files. Default path for checks: `python3 scripts/validate_skills.py`; portable listing stays aligned with [README.md](README.md) discovery ladder.
